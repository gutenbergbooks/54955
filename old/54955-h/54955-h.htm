<h2>PREFACE BY MRS. PANKHURST</h2>


<p>This history of the Women's Suffrage agitation
is written at a time when the question is in the very
forefront of British politics. What the immediate
future holds for those women who are most actively
engaged in fighting for their political freedom no
one can foretell, but one thing is certain: complete
victory for their cause is not far distant.</p>

<p>When the long struggle for the enfranchisement
of women is over, those who read the history of the
movement will wonder at the blindness that led the
Government of the day to obstinately resist so simple
and obvious a measure of justice.</p>

<p>The men and women of the coming time will, I
am persuaded, be filled with admiration for the
patient work of the early pioneers and the heroic
determination and persistence in spite of coercion,
repression, misrepresentation, and insult of those
who fought the later militant fight.</p>

<p>Perhaps the women born in the happier days that
are to come, while rejoicing in the inheritance that
we of to-day are preparing for them, may sometimes
wish that they could have lived in the heroic days
of stress and struggle and have shared with us the
joy of battle, the exaltation that comes of sacrifice
of self for great objects and the prophetic vision
that assures us of the certain triumph of this twentieth-century
fight for human emancipation.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In writing this history of the Militant Women's
Suffrage Movement I have endeavoured to give a
just and accurate account of its progress and happenings,
dealing fully with as many of its incidents as
space will permit. I have tried to let my readers
look behind the scenes in order that they may understand
both the steps by which the movement has
grown and the motives and ideas that have animated
its promoters.</p>

<p>I believe that women striving for enfranchisement
in other lands and reformers of future days may
learn with renewed hope and confidence how the
"family party," who in 1905 set out determined to
make votes for women the dominant issue of the
politics of their time, in but six years drew to their
standard the great woman's army of to-day. It is
certain that the militant struggle in which this
woman's army has engaged and which has come as
the climax to the long, patient effort of the earlier
pioneers, will rank amongst the great reform movements
of the world. Set as it has been in modern
humdrum days it can yet compare with any movement
for variety and vivacity of incident. The adventurous
and resourceful daring of the young Suffragettes
who, by climbing up on roofs, by sliding
down through skylights, by hiding under platforms,
constantly succeeded in asking their endless questions,
has never been excelled. What could be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
piquant than the fact that two of the Cabinet Ministers
who were carrying out a policy of coercion towards
the women should have been forced into the
witness box to be questioned and cross-questioned by
Miss Christabel Pankhurst, the prisoner in the dock?
What, too, could throw a keener searchlight upon
the methods of our statesmen than the evidence put
forward in the course of that trial?</p>

<p>To many of our contemporaries perhaps the most
remarkable feature of the militant movement has
been the flinging-aside by thousands of women of
the conventional standards that hedge us so closely
round in these days for a right that large numbers
of men who possess it scarcely value. Of course it
was more difficult for the earlier militants to break
through the conventionalities than for those who followed,
but, as one of those associated with the movement
from its inception, I believe that the effort was
greater for those who first came forward to stand by
the originators than for the little group by whom the
first blows were struck. I believe this because I
know that the original militants were already in close
association with the truth that not only were the
deeds of the old time pioneers and martyrs glorious,
but that their work still lacks completion, and that
it behoves those of us who have grasped an idea
for human betterment to endure, if need be, social
ostracism, violence, and hardship of all kinds, in
order to establish it. Moreover, whilst the originators
of the militant tactics let fly their bolt, as it
were, from the clear sky, their early associates rallied
to their aid in the teeth of all the fierce and bitter
opposition that had been raised.</p>

<p>The hearts of students of the movement in after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
years will be stirred by the faith and endurance shown
by the women who faced violence at the hands of the
police and others in Parliament Square and at the
Cabinet Minister meetings, and above all by the heroism
of the noble women who went through the hunger
strike and the mental and physical torture of forcible
feeding.</p>

<p>A passionate love of freedom, a strong desire to do
social service and an intense sympathy for the unfortunate,
together, made the movement possible in
its present form. Those who have worked as a part
of it know that it is notable not merely for its enthusiasm
and courage, but also for its cheery spirit
of loyalty and comradeship, its patient thoroughness
in organisation which has made possible its many
great demonstrations and processions, its freedom
from bitterness and recrimination, and its firm faith
in the right.</p>

<small>EARLY DAYS</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent center"><span class="smcap">From the Formation of the Women's Social and
Political Union to the Summer of 1905.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>From her girlhood my mother, the founder of
the Women's Social and Political Union, had been
inspired by stories of the early reform movements,
and even before this, at an age when most children
have scarcely learnt their alphabet, her father,
Robert Goulden, of Manchester, set her to read his
newspaper to him at breakfast and thus awakened
her lasting interest in politics.</p>

<p>The Franco-German War was still a much-discussed
event when Robert Goulden took his thirteen-year-old
daughter to school in Paris, placing her at
the Ecole Normale, where she became the room-companion
of Henri Rochfort's daughter, Noémie.
Noémie Rochfort told her little English schoolfellow
much of her own father's adventurous career,
and Emmeline Goulden soon became an ardent and
enthusiastic republican. She was now delighted to
discover that she had been born on the anniversary
of the destruction of the Bastille and was proud
to tell her friend that her own grandmother had
been an earnest politician, and one of the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
members of the Anti-Corn Law League, and that
her grandfather had narrowly escaped death upon
the field of Peterloo. Even before her school days
in Paris she had been taken by her mother to a
Women's Suffrage meeting addressed by Miss Lydia
Becker.</p>

<p>On returning home to England, Emmeline
Goulden settled down at seventeen years of age to
help her mother in the care of her eight younger
brothers and sisters, and when she was twenty-one
she married Dr. Richard Marsden Pankhurst, who
was many years older than herself, and had long
been well known as a public man.</p>

<p>Dr. Pankhurst had been one of the founders of
the pioneer Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee
and one of its most active workers in the early
days. He had drafted the original Women's Enfranchisement
Bill, then called the Women's Disabilities
Removal Bill, to give votes to women on the
same terms as men, which had first been introduced
by Mr. Jacob Bright in 1870 and had then passed
its Second Reading in the House of Commons by
a majority of thirty-three. With Lord Coleridge,
Dr. Pankhurst had acted as counsel for the women
who had claimed to be put upon the Parliamentary
Register in the case of Chorlton v. Lings in 1868.
He was also at the time one of the most prominent
members of the Married Women's Property Committee
and had drafted the Bill to give married
women the absolute right to their own property and
to sue and be sued in the Courts of Law, which was
so soon to be placed as an Act upon the Statute
Book. Two years before this great Act became
law, Mrs. Pankhurst was elected to the Married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Women's Property Committee, and at the same time
she became a member of the Manchester Women's
Suffrage Committee.</p>

<p>In 1889 my parents helped to form the Women's
Franchise League. My sister Christabel and I,
then nine and seven years old, already took a lively
interest in all the proceedings, and tried as hard
as we could to make ourselves useful, writing out
notices in big, uncertain letters and distributing leaflets
to the guests at a three days' Conference held in
our own home. About this time we two children
had begun to attend Women's Suffrage and other
public meetings, and these we reported in a little
manuscript magazine, which we both wrote and illustrated.
When some few years afterwards, owing
chiefly to lack of funds and the ill health of its most
prominent workers, the Women's Franchise League
was discontinued, Dr. and Mrs. Pankhurst returned
to Manchester and worked mainly for general questions
of social reform. Years before, my mother
had joined the Women's Liberal Federation in the
hope that it would work to remove both the political
and economic grievances of women and to raise the
status of women generally, but finding that the Federation
was being used merely to forward the interests
of the Liberal Party, of which women could not be
members and in the formation of whose programme
they were allowed no voice, she had resigned her
membership. In 1894 she and Dr. Pankhurst joined
the Independent Labour Party, one of the decisive
reasons for this step being that, unlike the Liberal
and Conservative parties, the Independent Labour
Party admitted men and women to membership on
equal terms. In the same year Mrs. Pankhurst was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
elected to the Chorlton Board of Guardians, and
remained a member of that body for four years.
This experience taught her much of the pressing
needs of the poor, and of the bitter hardships, especially,
of the women's lives.</p>

<p>After Dr. Pankhurst's death, in 1898, Mrs. Pankhurst
retired from the Board of Guardians and became
a Registrar of Births and Deaths.</p>

<p>For the next few years, my mother took no active
part in politics, except as a member of the Manchester
School Board,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but in 1901 my sister
Christabel became greatly interested in the Suffrage
propaganda organised by Miss Esther Roper, Miss
Eva Gore-Booth, and Mrs. Sarah Dickinson amongst
the women textile workers. She was also elected to
the Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee, of
which Miss Roper was Secretary. Christabel soon
struck out a new line for herself. Impressed by the
growing strength of the Labour Movement she began
to see the necessity of converting to the question
of Women's Suffrage the various Trade Union organisations,
which were upon the eve of becoming a
concrete force in politics. She therefore made it her
business to address as many of the Trade Unions as
were willing to receive her.</p>

<p>We were all much interested in Christabel's work
and my mother's enthusiasm was quickly re-awakened.
The experiences of her later years had
brought her a keener insight into the results of the
political disabilities of women, against which she had
rebelled as a high-spirited girl, and she now realised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>more strongly than ever before, the urgent and immediate
need for the enfranchisement of her sex. She
became filled with the consciousness that her duty lay
in forcing this one question into the forefront of
practical politics, even if in so doing she should
find it necessary to give up all her other work. The
Women's Suffrage cause, and the various ways in
which to further its interests were now constantly
present in all our minds. A glance at the early
history of the movement, to say nothing of personal
experience, was enough to show that the Liberal and
Conservative parties had no intention of taking the
question up, and, after mature consideration, my
mother at last decided that a separate women's
organisation must be formed. Therefore, on October
10th, 1903, she invited a number of women to
meet at our home, 62 Nelson Street, Manchester,
and the Women's Social and Political Union was
formed. Almost all the women who were present
on that original occasion were working-women,
Members of the Labour Movement, but it was decided
from the first that the Union should be entirely
independent of Class and Party.</p>

<p>The phrase "Votes for Women" was now for the
first time in the history of the movement adopted
as a watchword by the new Union. The propaganda
work was at first mainly carried on amongst the
women workers of Lancashire and Yorkshire and,
in the Spring of 1904, as a result of the Women's
Social and Political Union's activities, the Annual
Conference of the Independent Labour Party instructed
its Administrative Council to prepare a Bill
for the Enfranchisement of Women to be laid before
Parliament in the forthcoming session. This Resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
though carried by an overwhelming majority,
had been bitterly opposed by a minority of the Conference,
who asserted that the Labour Party should
not concern itself with a partial measure of enfranchisement,
but should work directly to secure universal
adult suffrage for both men and women.</p>

<p>Therefore, before preparing any special measure,
the National Administrative Council of the Independent
Labour Party went very carefully into the
whole question. They were advised by Mr. Keir
Hardie and others who understood Parliamentary
procedure that a measure for universal adult suffrage,
which would not only bring about most sweeping
changes, but would open countless avenues for
discussion and consequent obstruction, could never
hope to be carried through Parliament except by the
responsible Government of the day. It was, therefore,
useless for the Labour representatives to attempt
to introduce such a measure. In addition to this, it
was pointed out that, whilst a large majority of the
Members of the House of Commons had already
pledged themselves to support an equal Bill to give
votes to women on the same terms as men, no substantial
measure of Parliamentary support had as
yet been obtained for adult suffrage, even if confined
to men. Taking into consideration also the
present state of both public and Parliamentary feeling
and with a million more women than men in the
British Isles, there was absolutely no chance of carrying
into law any proposal to give a vote to every
grown man and woman in the country. Having thus
arrived at the conclusion that an adult suffrage
measure was out of the question, the Council now
carefully inquired into the various classes of women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who were possessed of the qualifications which would
have entitled them to vote had they been men. On
its being ascertained that the majority would be
householders, whose names were already upon the
register of Municipal voters, the following circular
was addressed to all the Independent Labour Party
branches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We address to your branch a very urgent request to ascertain
from your local voting register the following particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The total number of electors in the Ward.</p>
<p>(2) The total number of women voters.</p>
<p>(3) The number of women voters of the working classes.</p>
<p>(4) The number of voters not of the working classes.</p>


<p>It is impossible to lay down a strict definition of the term
"working classes," but for this purpose it will be sufficient
to regard as working-class women, those who work for
wages, who are domestically employed, or who are supported
by the earnings of wage-earning children.</p>
</div>

<p>It was not unnatural, that the majority of the
branches failed to comply with a request which
obviously entailed a very extensive work. Nevertheless
returns were sent in from between forty and
fifty different towns and districts in various parts of
the country and these showed the following results:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving these figures, the National Council
of the Independent Labour Party decided to adopt
the original Women's Enfranchisement Bill, which
passed its Second Reading in 1870. The text of
the Bill was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In all Acts relating to the qualifications and registration
of voters or persons entitled or claiming to be registered
and to vote in the election of members of Parliament, wherever
words occur which import the masculine gender the
same shall be held to include women for all purposes connected
with and having reference to the right to be registered
as voters and to vote in such election, any law or
usage to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile we of the Women's Social and Political
Union were eagerly looking forward to the new
session of Parliament. It is indeed wonderful, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the midst of the great Women's Movement that is
present with us to-day, to look back upon its small
beginnings in that dreary and dismal time not yet
six years ago. It seemed then well-nigh impossible
to rouse the London women from their apathy upon
this question, for the old Suffrage workers had lost
heart and energy in the long struggle and those who
had joined them in recent days saw no prospect that
votes for women would ever come to pass.</p>

<p>I myself was then a student at the Royal College
of Art, South Kensington, but I decided to absent
myself in order to help my mother, who had come
down from Manchester to "lobby," as it is called,
on those few important days. The House met on
Tuesday, February 13th, and during the eight days
which intervened before the result of the Private
Members' ballot was made known we spent the whole
of our time in the Strangers' Lobby striving to
induce every Member who had pledged himself to
support Women's Suffrage to agree that his chance
in the ballot should be given to a Women's Suffrage
Bill. It was my first experience of Lobbying. I
knew we had an uphill task before us, but I had no
conception of how hard and discouraging it was to
be. Members of Parliament all told us that they
had pledged themselves to do "something for their
constituents" or had some other measure in which
they were interested, or had not been in Parliament
long and preferred to wait until they had more
experience before they would care to ballot for a
Bill at all. Oh, yes, they were "in favour" of
Women's Suffrage; they believed that "the ladies
ought to have votes," but they really could not give
their places in the ballot for the question; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
always "anything but that," and during the whole
of the week we spent in the Lobby we did not
succeed in adding one single promise to that
which we had originally received from Mr. Keir
Hardie.</p>

<p>On the fateful Wednesday on which the result was
declared, my mother and I were the only women in
the Lobby. We sat there on the shiny black leather
seats in the circular hall waiting for the result, and
at last we saw with relief Mr. Keir Hardie's picturesque
figure coming hurrying towards us from the
Inner Lobby. He was so kind and helpful, the only
kind and helpful person in the whole of Parliament,
it seemed. At once he told us that his name had
not been drawn in the ballot and explained that only
the first twelve, or, at most, fourteen, places that had
been drawn could be of any use to the Members who
had secured them, and that, owing to the limited
number of days upon which private Members' Bills
could be discussed, only the first three or four had
even a moderately good chance of becoming law.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Our next move must therefore be to get in touch
with the successful fourteen Members and to endeavour
to persuade one of them to devote his place
in the ballot to a Women's Suffrage Bill. After
considerable trouble we finally got into communication
with all of them, and they all said "No," with the
exception of Mr. Bamford Slack, who held the fourteenth
place, and who at last agreed to introduce our
Bill, largely because his wife was a Suffragist and
helped us to urge our cause. Of course the fourteenth
place was not by any means a good one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Bill was set down as the Second Order of the
Day for Friday, May 12th.</p>

<p>In the meantime we drafted a petition in support
of it and set ourselves to procure signatures. One
Sunday evening I went with a bundle of petition
forms to a meeting addressed by Mr. G. K. Chesterton
at Morriss Hall, Clapham. The lecturer's
remarks were devoted to a eulogy of the French
Revolution, from which he asserted all ideas of popular
representation had sprung. An opening, which
I seized, was given for a question on the subject of
votes for women in relation to the Government of
our Colonies. Whilst the audience were asking
questions and offering criticisms, Mr. Chesterton was
busily making sketches of us all, but, though I saw
myself being added to the picture gallery, in replying
to the questions raised in the debate afterwards,
he did not answer my point. Afterwards, however,
he came up and told me that he had forgotten to
deal with it and then gave me an explanation. I
had not asked, "Are you in favour of Votes for
Women?" I had assumed that he was and he
replied on the same assumption, and afterwards voluntarily
signed his name to my petition. It was with
surprise, not untempered with amusement, therefore,
that I afterwards found Mr. Chesterton coming forward
as an active anti-Suffragist, but his attitude
seemed to me to be an augury of our speedy success,
for he delights to champion unpopular causes and to
oppose himself to the overwhelming and inevitable
march of coming events.</p>

<p>Many other women's societies, suffrage, organised
petitions at this time, for the fact of having a Bill
before the House of Commons for the first time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
eight years, had sent a thrill of new life through
them all. The result of our united efforts was that,
when the twelfth of May came round, the Strangers'
Lobby was densely crowded, and many of the women
had to be drafted on to the Terrace, or to stand
in the various passages leading from the Lobby.
As well as the members of the various suffrage societies,
women of all classes, from the richest to the
poorest, were represented in the gathering, and
amongst the rest was a large contingent of women
Co-operators, accompanied by Mrs. Nellie Alma
Martel, of Australia, who had helped to win votes
for women there, and had afterwards been run as a
candidate for the Commonwealth Parliament, having
polled more than 20,000 votes.</p>

<p>Many of the women were quite pathetically confident
that we were going to get Women's Suffrage
then and there, but those of us who knew rather more,
both of the stubborn character of our opponents and
the antiquated Parliamentary procedure which renders
it possible for a handful of obstructionists to
block any private Member's measure unless the Government
will come to its aid, knew that the Women's
Enfranchisement Bill stood in a very precarious position.
The question which occupied the first place on
the day for which our own measure had been set
down, was a simple, practically non-contentious little
Bill, the object of which was to provide that carts
travelling along the public roads by night should
carry a light behind as well as before. We had spent
weeks in bringing all possible pressure to bear, both
upon the promoters of the Roadway Lighting Bill,
that they might withdraw their measure, and upon
the Conservative Government, in the hope that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
would give special facilities for the further discussion
of the Bill. In both directions we met with a refusal,
but we would not give up hope. Finally on
the very day of the Second Reading, when the anti-Suffragists
(as we had already foreseen would be the
case) were amusing themselves by spinning out the
debate on the Roadway Lighting Bill by pointless
jokes and contemptible absurdities, Mrs. Pankhurst
sent a message to Mr. Balfour telling him that if
facilities for the passing into law of the Women's
Enfranchisement Bill were not granted, the Women's
Social and Political Union would work actively
against the Government at the next General Election.
This message produced no apparent effect;
and from the meeting of the House, at twelve o'clock
until half-past four in the afternoon, the discussion
upon the Roadway Lighting Bill continued. Then
only half an hour remained for our Bill, and this,
amid irresponsible laughter, was "talked out."</p>

<p>The news of what was being done had gradually
filtered into the Lobby, and the attitude of the assembled
women had changed from one of pleased
expectancy to anger and dismay. A feeling of tense
excitement seemed to run through the gathering.
Some of the faces were flushed and others white,
whilst many had tears in their eyes. Especially
amongst the working women Co-operators feeling
was running high. These women were eagerly
looking forward to the time when they would be
able to take their part side by side with men in settling
the terrible social problems with which they
were met on every hand. They bitterly resented
the way in which they were being insulted by Members
of the House of Commons; they wanted to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
something to express their feelings of disapproval
and when the order for strangers to leave the House
was given, many of them seemed disinclined to go.
Then some of the women who had been listening
to the debate from behind the Grille in the Ladies'
gallery, came down into the Lobby and told us that
a strange man in the adjoining gallery had suddenly
sprung up to protest against the way in which our
question was being "talked out," he had been thrown
out of the House by the police, and was now at
the entrance to the Lobby. This piece of news
created a diversion. The women flocked out to
thank him. It was not until afterwards that we
or they learned that the man was one of the unemployed
bootmakers who had marched up from
Leicester, and that he had not made his protest in
our favour, but because he saw that the House was
wasting hour after hour in laughing and joking,
though the Government had assured him that it had
no time to attend to the grievances of starving men.</p>

<p>My mother now suggested that a meeting of
protest should be held outside, and Mrs. Wolstenholme
Elmy, the oldest worker in the Suffrage movement
present, began to speak. The women crowded
round to listen, but almost at once the police ordered
us away and began striding in and out amongst us
and pushing us apart. We thereupon moved to the
foot of the Richard I statue, which stands just
outside the door of the House of Lords, but again
the police intervened, till, at last, after much argument,
the Inspector of Police offered to take us
to a place where a meeting might be held. Mrs.
Pankhurst then called upon Mrs. Martel, as an
Australian woman voter, to lead us and, joined by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
single Member of Parliament, Mr. Keir Hardie, we
marched with the police to Broad Sanctuary, close
to the gates of Westminster Abbey. Here we
adopted a Resolution condemning the procedure of
the House of Commons, which had made it possible
for a small minority of opponents to prevent a vote
being taken upon the Women's Enfranchisement
Bill, and calling upon the Government to rescue it
now and carry it into law. The meeting then dispersed,
vowing political vengeance upon the Government
if this should not be done.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that during the summer of
1905 it was evident to the most casual observer
that the resignation of the Conservative Government
could not be long delayed. Mr. Chamberlain's
Tariff Reform proposals were causing dissent in the
Cabinet, and the resignation of several Ministers had
already taken place. The South African War had
brought a measure of overwhelmingly enthusiastic
support to the Conservative Government but, as
almost always happens in such cases, a reaction had
set in, now that the war taxes had to be met. At the
same time there was grave depression in the cotton
trade, and consequent distress in the industrial districts.
In order to cope with the trouble, Mr.
Walter Long, on behalf of the Government, had
introduced a Bill to provide relief work for the
unemployed. This had met with serious opposition
from his own party, and it had been subsequently
announced that no further time could be found for
the discussion of the measure. At this point the
dispute which had arisen between the Scottish Free
Church and the United Free Church of Scotland had
become acute, and on June 7th, Mr. Balfour had introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Scottish Churches Bill, which was hurried
through its various stages and finally passed on
July 26th. It was urged that the Government ought
not to have brought forward this new measure
whilst the unemployed workmen Bill, to which they
were already committed, had been set aside for lack
of time. But Mr. Balfour excused himself by protesting
that he had been obliged to carry the Scottish
Churches Bill because a "crisis" had arisen.</p>

<p>The unemployed and their leaders now stated that
if Mr. Balfour needed a crisis to make him act,
they would certainly provide him with a crisis. An
uprising on a small scale accordingly took place in
Manchester, in the course of which the unemployed,
in spite of police prohibition, persisted in holding a
meeting in Albert Square. Afterwards they marched
in an irregular mass along Market Street, spreading
all over the roadway and obstructing the traffic. A
struggle with the police ensued, during which four
men were arrested. The question of the Manchester
"riot," as it was called, was at once raised by Mr.
Keir Hardie as a matter of urgency in the House
of Commons and, as a result, it was hastily carried
through its remaining stages, though in a modified
form.</p>

<p>We of the Women's Social and Political Union
had been much interested by the situation that had
arisen, both in regard to the Unemployed and the
Scottish Churches, and we determined to profit by
the example of those who, by determined and decisive
action, had secured a certain measure of consideration
for their claims. It was only a question now
of how much longer militant tactics were to be delayed,
and as to how they were to be inaugurated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
A favourable opportunity for their dramatic commencement
had not yet presented itself, but there
was plenty of necessary propaganda work for the
Women's Social and Political Union to do.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening in June, Mrs. Pankhurst had
been invited to speak on Women's Suffrage to a
meeting held under the auspices of the Oldham Independent
Labour Party. During the proceedings
glees were sung by a choir of men and women cotton
operatives, and one of the members of the choir
was Annie Kenney, who was afterwards to take so
prominent a part in the Votes for Women Movement.
Annie Kenney was deeply impressed by all
that Mrs. Pankhurst had to say, and shortly afterwards,
when my sister Christabel also lectured in
Oldham, she asked to be introduced to her. Christabel
then asked her to pay a visit to our home in
Manchester, and the friendship which was to have
such far-reaching results began.</p>

<p>Annie Kenney was born at Lees, near Oldham.
She was the child of working-class parents, and, to
supplement her father's earnings, her mother, in addition
to all her household cares, had been obliged
to go out to work in a cotton mill most of her married
life. Annie Kenney herself had early become a
wage-earner, for at ten years of age she secured an
engagement as a half-timer in one of the Oldham
cotton factories. Then, wearing her heavy steel-tipped
clogs, her fair hair hanging down her back in
a long plait covered by a shawl, she had gone into
the hot, crowded spinning mill, and working amid
the noisy jarring of the machinery as a "little tenter"
at the disposal of three older women, she had learnt
to fit into place the big bobbins covered with fleecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
strands of soft, raw cotton; and to piece these same
fleecy strands when they broke, as they did so often,
whilst they were being spun out thinner and stronger.
Once, as she seized the broken thread in her tiny
fingers, one of them was caught somehow and torn
off by the whirling bobbins. Whilst she was still a
half-timer she worked alternately, one week from
six o'clock in the morning till midday in the mill,
and during the afternoon at the elementary school;
and the next week she spent the morning at school
and four hours of the afternoon in the mill. At
thirteen, her school days had ceased, and she had
become a "full-timer," working in the mill from
six o'clock in the morning till six at night.</p>

<p>This premature launching forth into the world
of wage-earners had left its mark upon Annie Kenney.
Her features had been sharpened by it, and
her eager face that flushed so easily was far more
deeply lined than are the faces of girls whose childhood
has been prolonged. Those wide, wide eyes
of hers, so wonderfully blue, though at rare moments
they could dance and sparkle like a fountain in the
sunshine, were more often filled with pain, anxiety
and foreboding, or with a longing restless, searching,
unsatisfied and far away. A member of a very large
family, Annie had four sisters&mdash;Nellie, Kitty, Jennie,
and Jessie&mdash;who came nearest her in age and
had been her companions in the cotton mill. In spite
of the fact that they were constantly obliged to rise
at four or five in the morning, in order to reach the
factory gates at six o'clock, and on returning home
were obliged first to help to do the housework and
prepare the evening meal for the rest of the family,
these girls were all determined to continue their education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and they regularly attended the Oldham night
schools. At the time when we first met Annie, Nellie
and Kitty, the two eldest of the sisters, had both
worked their way out of the cotton mill. Nellie had
become a shop assistant, and had soon proved herself
so able that she had been put in charge of two of
her employer's shops, whilst Kitty had passed the
necessary examinations and had obtained a post as
an elementary school teacher, and Jennie, though
still in the mill, was studying with the same object.
Jessie, who was but sixteen, was learning typewriting
and shorthand.</p>

<p>Annie, who was then twenty-five, was unlike her
sisters in many ways. She frequently said that she
was not so "clever" as her sisters, but when any
decisive step was to be taken or any question of principle
to be decided, it was always Annie who took
the lead. There is not much that is beautiful in a
small Lancashire manufacturing town, but what little
there was, Annie Kenney contrived to make the most
of. She was a regular attendant at the Church, and
delighted in the beauty of the music; the Whitsuntide
processions, in which she walked with the other
Sunday-school children all in their white dresses,
being vivid memories with her still. She early commenced
to carry on a literary campaign amongst her
work-mates and, having come across a copy of the
penny weekly paper "The Clarion," in which Robert
Blatchford was publishing a series of articles on his
"favourite books," contrived to procure some of
the works which were there mentioned, and introduced
them to her companions.</p>

<p>On the few holidays which fall to the lot of the
cotton worker, or when the mills were stopped owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to bad trade, Annie Kenney and her sisters and some
of their favourite work-mates would put together a
simple luncheon and set off roaming for miles across
the moors. The grass and the trees might be blackened
with the smoke of the factories, the sight of
whose tall chimneys the girls could never leave behind,
but, blighted as it was, this was the only country
that Annie had ever known, and it was all beautiful
to her. When they had walked till they were
tired, the girls would lie down on the grass, and then
they would read to each other in turn, and Annie
would talk to them about the flowers and the sky.</p>

<p>Just as she was intensely alive to all that was beautiful,
so too Annie Kenney realised keenly the ugly
and sordid side of life. When speaking of her early
days to a conference of women in Germany, in 1908,
she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I grew up in the midst of women and girls in the works,
and I saw the hard lives of the women and children about
me. I noticed the great difference made in the treatment
of men and women in the factory, differences in conditions,
differences in wages and differences in status. I realised
this difference not in the factory alone but in the home.
I saw men, women, boys and girls, all working hard during
the day in the same hot, stifling factories. Then when
work was over I noticed that it was the mothers who hurried
home, who fetched the children that had been put out
to nurse, prepared the tea for the husband, did the cleaning,
baking, washing, sewing and nursing. I noticed that when
the husband came home, his day's work was over; he took
his tea and then went to join his friends in the club or in
the public house, or on the cricket or foot-ball field, and
I used to ask myself why this was so. Why was the
mother the drudge of the family, and not the father's companion
and equal?</p>

<p>From the first we found Annie ready with excellent
ideas for spreading our propaganda. In Lancashire
every little town and village has its "Wakes
Week." The "Wakes" being a sort of Fair, at
which there are "merry-go-rounds," "cocoanut
shies," and numberless booths and stalls where human
and animal monstrosities are shown and all
kinds of things are sold. In every separate town or
village the "Wakes" is held at a different date, so
that within a radius of a few miles one or other of
these fairs is going on all through the summer and
autumn. Annie told us that on the Sunday before
the "Wakes" almost all the inhabitants of the place
go down to the "Wakes-ground" and walk amongst
the booths, and that Salvation Army and other
preachers, temperance orators, the vendors of quack
medicines and others seize this opportunity of addressing
the crowds. She suggested that we should
follow their example. We readily agreed, and all
through that summer and autumn we held these meetings,
going from Stalybridge to Royton, Mosely,
Oldham, Lees where Annie lived, and to a dozen
other towns.</p>

<small>THE BEGINNING OF THE MILITANT
TACTICS</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent center"><span class="smcap">Arrest and Imprisonment of Christabel Pankhurst
and Annie Kenney. October, 1905.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Whilst the educational propaganda work of the
Women's Social and Political Union was being
quietly carried on, stirring events were in preparation.
The resignation of the Conservative Government
was daily expected. The Liberal leaders were
preparing themselves to take office, and every newspaper
in the country was discussing who the new
Ministers were to be. A stir of excitement was
spreading all over the country and now the organisers
of the Liberal Party decided to hold a great
revival meeting in that historic Manchester Free
Trade Hall, which stands upon the site of the old
franchise battle of Peterloo. The meeting was
fixed for October 13th, and here it was determined
that the old fighting spirit of the Radicals should
be revived, the principles and policy of Liberalism
should be proclaimed anew and, upon the strength of
those principles and of that policy, the people should
be called upon to support the incoming Government
with voice and vote.</p>

<p>When the evening of the thirteenth came, the
great hall was filled to overflowing with an audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mainly composed of enthusiastic Liberals, for the
meeting was almost entirely a ticket one, and the
tickets had been circulated amongst the Liberal Associations
throughout the length and breadth of Lancashire.
The organ played victorious music, and then
the Liberal men, whose party had been out of office
for so long and who now saw it coming into power,
rose to their feet and cheered excitedly as their leaders
came into the hall. After a few brief words from
the chairman, words in which he struck a note of
triumphant confidence in the approaching Liberal
victory, Sir Edward Grey was called upon to speak.
The future Cabinet Minister, in a speech full of fine
sentiments and glowing promises, named all the
various great reforms that the Liberal Government
would introduce, and appealed to the people to give
the Liberal Party its confidence, and to return a
Liberal ministry to power. Whilst he was speaking,
Sir Edward Grey was interrupted by a man who
asked him what the Government proposed to do for
the unemployed. Sir Edward paused with ready
courtesy to listen. "Somebody said the unemployed,"
he explained to the audience; "well, I will
come to that," and he did so, saying that this important
question would certainly be dealt with. Then
he came to his peroration; he spoke of the difficulties
of administration, difficulties which were especially
great at the present time. "We ask for the Liberal
Party," he said, "the same chance as the Conservative
Party has had for nearly twenty years....
There is no hope in the present men, but there is hope
in new men.... It is to new men with fresh
minds, untrammelled by prejudice and quickened by
sympathy, and who are vigorous and true, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
believe that the country will turn with hope. What
I ask for them is generous support and a fair
chance." The thunder of applause that greeted his
final words had scarcely died away when, as if in
answer to Sir Edward Grey's appeal and promise, a
little white cotton banner, inscribed with the words,
"<span class="smcap">Votes for Women</span>," was put up in the centre
of the hall, and a woman was heard asking what
the Government would do to make the women politically
free. Almost simultaneously two or three men
were upon their feet demanding information upon
other questions. The men were at once replied to,
but the woman's question was ignored. She therefore
stood up again and pressed for an answer to
her question, but the men sitting near her forced her
down into her seat, and one of the stewards of the
meeting held his hat over her face. Meanwhile,
the hall was filled with a babel of conflicting sound.
Shouts of "Sit down!" "Be quiet!" "What's the
matter?" and "Let the lady speak!" were heard
on every hand. As the noise subsided a little, a second
woman sitting beside the first got up and asked
again, "Will the Liberal Government give women
the vote?" but Sir Edward Grey made no answer,
and again arose the tumult of cries and counter cries.
Then the Chief Constable of Manchester, Mr.
William Peacock, came down from the platform to
where the women were sitting, and asked them to
write out the question that they had put to Sir
Edward Grey, saying that he would himself take it
to the Chairman and make sure that it received a
reply. The women agreed to this suggestion, and
the one who had first spoken now wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Will the Liberal Government give votes to working
women?</p>

<p>Signed on behalf of the Women's Social and Political
Union,</p>

<p class="p1">ANNIE KENNEY,</p>
<p>Member of the Oldham Committee of the
Card and Blowing Room Operatives.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">To this she added that as one of the 96,000 organised
women cotton workers, and for their sake, she
earnestly desired an answer. Mr. Peacock took the
paper on which the question had been written back
to the platform, and was seen to hand it to Sir
Edward Grey, who, having read it, smiled and passed
it to the Chairman, from whom it went the round of
every speaker in turn. Then it was laid aside, and
no answer was returned to it. A lady, sitting on the
platform, who had noticed and understood all that
was going on, now tried to intervene.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "May I,
as a woman, be allowed to speak&mdash;?" she began,
but the Chairman called on Lord Durham to move
a vote of thanks to Sir Edward Grey. When this
vote had been seconded by Mr. Winston Churchill,
and when it had afterwards been carried, Sir Edward
Grey rose to reply. But he made no reference,
either to the enfranchisement of women, or to the
question which had been put. Then followed the
carrying of a vote of thanks to the Chair, and by
this time the meeting showed signs of breaking up.
Some of the audience had left the hall, and some of
the people on the platform were preparing to go.
The women's question still remained unanswered and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>seemed in danger of being forgotten by everyone concerned.
But the two women were anxiously awaiting
a reply, and the one who had first spoken now rose
again, and this time she stood up upon her seat and
called out as loudly as she could, "Will the Liberal
Government give working women the vote?" At
once the audience became a seething, infuriated mob.
Thousands of angry men were upon their feet shouting,
gesticulating, and crying out upon the woman
who had again dared to disturb their meeting.</p>

<p>She stood there above them all, a little, slender,
fragile figure. She had taken off her hat, and her
soft, loosely flowing hair gave her a childish look;
her cheeks were flushed and her blue eyes blazing
with earnestness. It was Annie Kenney, the mill
girl, who had gone to work in an Oldham cotton
factory as a little half-timer at ten years of age.
A working woman, the child of a working woman,
whose life had been passed amongst the workers, she
stood there now, feeling herself to be the representative
of thousands of struggling women, and in their
name she asked for justice. But the Liberal leaders,
who had spoken so glibly of sympathy for the poor
and needy, were silent now, when one stood there
asking for justice; and their followers, who had listened
so eagerly and applauded with so much enthusiasm,
speeches filled with the praise of liberty
and equality, were thinking now of nothing but
Liberal victories. They howled at her fiercely, and
numbers of Liberal stewards came hurrying to drag
her down. Then Christabel Pankhurst, her companion,
started up and put one arm around Annie
Kenney's waist, and with the other warded off their
blows, and as she did so, they scratched and tore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
her hands until the blood ran down on Annie's hat
that lay upon the seat, and stained it red, whilst
she still called, "The question, the question, answer
the question!" So, holding together, these two
women fought for votes as their forefathers had
done, upon the site of Peterloo.</p>

<p>At last six men, Liberal stewards and policemen
in plain clothes, seized Christabel Pankhurst and
dragged her away down the central aisle and past
the platform, then others followed bringing Annie
Kenney after her. As they were forced along the
women still looked up and called for an answer to
their question, and still the Liberal leaders on the
platform looked on apparently unmoved and never
said a word. As they saw the women dragged away,
the men in the front seats&mdash;the ticket holders from
the Liberal clubs&mdash;shouted "Throw them out!"
but from the free seats at the back, the people answered
"Shame!"</p>

<p>Having been flung out into the street, the two
women decided to hold an indignation meeting there,
and so, at the corner of Peter Street and South
Street, close to the hall, they began to speak, but
within a few minutes, they were arrested, and followed
by hundreds of men and women, were dragged
to the Town Hall. Here they were both charged
with obstruction, and Christabel Pankhurst was also
accused of assaulting the police. They were summoned
to attend the Police Court in Minshull Street
next morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as soon as the women had been
thrown out of the hall, there came a revulsion of
feeling in their favour and the greater part of the
meeting broke up in disorder. Believing that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
explanation was expected of him, Sir Edward Grey
now said that he regretted the disturbance which had
taken place. "I am not sure" he continued "that
unwittingly and in innocence I have not been a contributing
cause. As far as I can understand, the
trouble arose from a desire to know my opinion on
the subject of Women's Suffrage. That is a question
which I would not deal with here to-night because
it is not, and I do not think it is likely to
be, a party question." He added that he had already
given his opinion upon votes for women and
that, as he did not think it a "fitting subject for
this evening," he would not repeat it.</p>

<p>Thus, within a few days of the fortieth anniversary
of the formation of the first Women's Suffrage Society
(perhaps even upon that very anniversary),
and after forty years of persevering labour for this
cause, Sir Edward Grey announced that Women's
Suffrage was as yet far outside the realm of practical
politics, and the two women who had dared to question
him upon this subject were flung with violence
and insult from the hall.</p>

<p>The next morning the police court was crowded
with people eager to hear the trial. The two girls
refused to dispute the police evidence as to the
charges of assault and obstruction, and based their
defence solely upon the principle that their conduct
was justified by the importance of the question upon
which they had endeavoured to secure a pronouncement
and by the outrageous treatment which they
had received. But though ignoring the violence to
which they had been subjected and exaggerating the
disturbance which they had made, the Counsel for
the prosecution had dwelt at length upon the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in the Free Trade Hall; the women were not allowed
to refer to it and, though it was evident that but
for what had taken place in the meeting they would
not have been arrested for speaking in the street,
they were ordered to confine their remarks to what
had taken place after they had been ejected. Both
defendants were found guilty, Christabel Pankhurst
being ordered to pay a fine of ten shillings or to go
to prison for seven days and Annie Kenney being
fined five shillings with the alternative of three days'
imprisonment. They both refused to pay the fines
and were immediately hurried away to the cells.</p>

<p>Now the whole country rang with the story. In
Manchester especially, the news created tremendous
excitement. The father of one of the prisoners,
was, as we have seen, a Manchester man. Dr.
Pankhurst's<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> remarkable ability and learning, his
wonderful eloquence, his wide range of interests, and
the number of causes in which he had taken a foremost
part, had secured for him an unusually large
amount of public recognition. There was scarcely
a man or woman in the city to whom he was not
a familiar figure. Moreover, his fascinating personality,
and his well-known tenderness of heart, illustrated
as it was by thousands of kindly acts, as well
as by his long life of service and sacrifice for the
public good, had endeared him to many of his strongest
political opponents. Whatever bitterness may
have been aroused against him by his strenuous advocacy
of advanced and frequently unpopular causes,
had disappeared when the news of his sudden death,
which took place in the midst of a legal case that
he was conducting on behalf of the Manchester Corporation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>had become known, and public sympathy
had gone generously forth to Mrs. Pankhurst in her
tragic home-coming when she had read of her great
loss in the evening papers in the train. Mrs.
Pankhurst by her work on public bodies was also
known of course, and Christabel Pankhurst herself
had recently attracted notice because, having wished
to follow her father's profession, she had applied
to the Benchers of Lincoln's Inn for admission to
the Bar. Her application had been refused on the
ground of her sex, as had also a request to be heard
by the Benchers in support of her claim, but she
had not abandoned her endeavours to secure the
opening of this avenue of employment to women and
she was now a Law student at the Victoria University of
Manchester.</p>

<p>Votes for Women in those days was regarded by
the majority of sober, level-headed men as a ladies'
fad which would never come to anything and the
idea that it could ever be a question upon which
governments would stand or fall, or be associated
with persecution, rioting and imprisonment had been
alike unthinkable to them. Therefore, for many
reasons, this trial and imprisonment came as a tremendous
shock to the general public of Manchester.
Questions addressed to political speakers by men in
the audience both during and at the close of the
speeches were, as everyone knew, the invariable accompaniment
of every public political meeting in this
country. These questions were almost always replied
to. When dissatisfied with the answer the
interrogators frequently began a running commentary
of disapproval, which sometimes terminated in
their ejection, but not until they had become a source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of general disturbance to the meeting. These facts
were of course a matter of common knowledge, but
the newspapers now ignored them and treated the
questioning of Sir Edward Grey in the manner
adopted by the two women in the Free Trade Hall
as an absolutely new and entirely reprehensible departure.
They were all agreed that such behaviour
would inevitably injure the Women's Suffrage Cause
of which, though they had hitherto boycotted it,
most of them now implied that they were supporters.
Extracts from two newspapers are enough to convey
the attitude which in varying degrees of severity
was adopted by them all. The <i>Evening Standard</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Magistrates were lenient in inflicting a small fine....
If Miss Pankhurst desires to go to gaol rather
than pay the money, let her go. Our only regret is that
the discipline will be identical with that experienced by
mature and sensible women, and not that which falls to
the lot of children in the nursery.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Birmingham <i>Daily Mail</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If any argument were required against giving to ladies
political status and power, it has been furnished in Manchester,
and by two of the people who are most strenuously
clamouring for the franchise.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason why the Press as a whole was against
the women was of course because every great newspaper
in this country is a special pleader, for one or
other of the two great political Parties&mdash;the Liberals
and the Conservatives&mdash;and both these Parties
looked upon the question which the women were
striving to urge forward, as something of a nuisance.
Unfortunately, vast numbers of people, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
examining into and thinking out a thing for themselves,
begin, at any rate, by allowing their opinions
to be formed for them by the particular newspapers
which they happen to read. Therefore some people
at once made up their minds that the women were
entirely in the wrong, because the papers said so.
Others, with strange obliquity of vision, because
they did not like the idea of women mixing themselves
up in scenes of violence, found it easier to disapprove
of the women who had been ill-used than of
those who had ill-used them. Besides the unthinking
ones, there were also many who had become so much
inflamed by Party spirit that their sole idea was to
whitewash and bolster up the Liberal leaders and
to cast a slur upon the character of any who had
dared to turn too fierce a light upon their faults
and weaknesses.</p>

<p>But with all this the imprisoned women were not
friendless and though for the time being, stone walls
and iron bars might prevent their speaking, there
were those outside who were determined to defend
and uphold them and to turn what they had done
to good. The Women's Social and Political Union
at once published a statement explaining that
in view of the approaching general election the
intentions of the Liberal leaders with regard to
Women's Suffrage had been recognised to be of
immense importance, and Sir Edward Grey had
therefore been asked to receive a deputation of
members of the Union, in which the questions it was
desired that he should answer were clearly
stated. No reply or acknowledgment of this request
had been received, and it had thereupon been
decided that two delegates from the Union should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
attend the Free Trade Hall meeting to question
Sir Edward Grey.</p>

<div id="Illus02" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="357" height="574" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney</p></div>
</div>

<p>Many who witnessed the scene in the Free Trade
Hall wrote to the newspapers expressing their sympathy
with the women.</p>

<p>A "sympathiser" apologised for having helped to
shout the women down saying that he would never
have done so had he realised what was really taking
place. On first reading the accounts, Mr. Keir
Hardie, the only Member of Parliament to come forward
in support of the prisoners, telegraphed, "The
thing is a dastardly outrage, but do not worry, it will
do immense good to the Cause. Can I do anything?"
Sir Edward Grey's wife, Lady Grey, made no public
statement but she told her friends that she considered
the women justified in the means they had adopted
of forcing their question forward. "What else
could they do?" she asked. Whilst Mr. Winston
Churchill, fearing probably that his approaching
candidature in Manchester might be damaged by the
imprisonment of the women, visited Strangeways
Gaol and offered to pay their fines, but the Governor
refused to accept the money from him.</p>

<p>On Friday, October 20th, a crowded demonstration
was held to welcome the Ex-prisoners in the Free
Trade Hall from which they had been flung out
with ignominy but a week before, and now, as they
entered, the audience rose with raised hats and waving
handkerchiefs and greeted them with cheers.
Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney did not
speak of their imprisonment. We knew that they
had been treated as belonging to the third and lowest
class of criminals, and that they had been dressed
in the prison clothes, fed on "skilly" and brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bread, and kept in solitary confinement in a narrow
cell both day and night; that they had attended services
with the other prisoners in the Chapel and with
them had gone out to exercise in the prison yard,
that they had performed the daily routine of prison
tasks and, losing their own names, had answered
only to the number of their cell. These things we
know, but <i>they</i> refused to speak of them then, wishing
that all attention should be concentrated upon
the cause of the enfranchisement of women for which
they had been willing to endure all.</p>

<p>But in spite of their own silence we have one picture
of Christabel during that first imprisonment. It
was brought out to us by one of the Visiting Justices,
a friend of her father, who, in the hope of inducing
her to allow her fine to be paid, had gone in to see her
in the prison cell. He found her clad in strangely
made, coarse serge garments, with large heavy shoes
upon her feet and with a white cap framing her
rosy face, and partly covering her soft brown hair.
Seated on a wooden stool she was working away at
her allotted task&mdash;the making of a shirt for one
of the men prisoners. Her dinner, consisting of
two or three small sodden-looking unpeeled potatoes
and a chunk of coarse brown bread, was lying beside
her and she was taking a bite of the bread every
now and then. "Don't you think you're a very
silly girl to sit here eating brown bread and potatoes
and sewing that shirt when you might be freely doing
what you please outside?" the Justice asked her.
But she smiled up at him brightly "Oh, no," she
said, "I always liked brown bread."</p>

<p>Fresh and bright and full of cheer as she had
been in her cell, though more serious, she was now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as she stood on the Free Trade Hall platform to
make her speech. When she began to tell the meeting
of the disturbance that had taken place upon the
previous Friday there were some cries of protest
from Liberals who disagreed with her, but she
stopped them saying "I am sure you want to hear
my side of the story," and when she had finished,
Resolutions calling for the immediate extension of
the franchise to women, commending the bravery of
the released prisoners' action and condemning the
behaviour of those who had refused to answer their
question were carried with tremendous enthusiasm.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent center">DR. PANKHURST&mdash;BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>In addition to his activities for Women's Suffrage, and
indeed, for all questions affecting the welfare of women,
which have been already referred to, Dr. Pankhurst had
taken an important part in many other reform movements.
He had been one of the most distinguished of the students
of Owen's College which paved the way for, and became
incorporated with, the newer Victoria University of Manchester.
Having studied at Owen's, he had taken his B.A.
degree at the London University in 1858, his LL.B., with
honours in Principles of Legislation in 1859, and LL.D.
with the gold medal in 1863. Called to the Bar in Lincoln's
Inn in 1867 he had joined the Northern Circuit and
become a member of the Bar of the County Palatine and
Lancaster Chancery Court. He had been Honorary Secretary
to the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Institutes
from 1863 to 1876 in which years he had laboured zealously
in the promotion of education, devoting much time to visiting
the various Mechanics Institutes, which largely owing
to his work were beginning to spring up as the forerunners
of the Technical Schools and Municipal Evening Classes of
to-day, teaching and addressing the students on educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
questions, and enlisting public sympathy in this important
work. Later, when in 1893, the subject of citizenship had,
owing primarily to his influence, been made a part of the
teaching of the evening continuation schools in Manchester,
Dr. Pankhurst had issued a scheme of political studies in
the form of an outline of political and social theory, and
in 1894 he had delivered a series of addresses on the "Life
and Duties of Citizenship," which were afterwards published.
In 1882 he had become a member of the Manchester Chamber
of Commerce and was recognised to be an authority
upon many commercial questions. He was one of the
earliest and most active workers of the Social Science
Association which did so much to educate public opinion
upon many questions affecting the welfare of women
and the community in general. Dr. Pankhurst had also
been the author of many important papers on the Patent
Laws, Local Courts and Tribunals, International Law,
the study of Jurisprudence, and other subjects. He had
interested himself greatly in public health and the general
field of sanitation, and had been concerned in many
public inquiries in regard to this matter. He had been a
life member of the Association for the Reform and Codification
of the Law of Nations, and had laid before that body
a scheme of international arbitration as a substitute for war,
a principle for which he had for many years strenuously
contended. He had three times been a candidate for Parliament,
having contested Manchester in 1883, Rotherhithe
in 1885, and Gorton in 1895, but because, admittedly, he
was too fearlessly honest and outspoken he had on each occasion
failed to secure election. Even by his bitterest political
opponents he was respected, for it was a matter of common
knowledge that, for the sake of his principles, he had over
and over again sacrificed his own material advancement.
He had begun life as an advanced Radical, having been a
friend of John Stuart Mill, also of Ernest Jones, and other
well-known Chartists. So long ago as 1873 he had been
a pronounced Home Ruler. He had been a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the executive of the National Reform Union, and the declaration
of principles which he had issued in his candidature
of 1883 has been ascribed as "a third Charter in itself."
By his fearless championship of their interests, and his sympathy
for them in time of trouble, he had especially endeared
himself to the working people. So early as the days
of George Odger and other leaders of the Labour cause,
he had taken part in a movement which resulted in the recasting
of the labour laws. He had acted as arbitrator for
the men in many cases of trade dispute. Whilst taking an
active part in the effort to secure both the later extensions
of the franchise which took place in 1867 and 1884, Dr.
Pankhurst had, as we have seen, done all he could to get
women included under them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE GENERAL ELECTION OF 1906</small></h2>


<p>After the inauguration of the militant tactics on
October 13th, we determined not to let the matter
rest until we had obtained a definite pledge that the
incoming Liberal Government would give votes to
women. On December 4th came the long-expected
resignation of Mr. Balfour, and the King then called
upon Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal
leader, to form an Administration. It was now announced
that a great demonstration should be held
on December 21st in the Royal Albert Hall, at which,
surrounded by every member of his Cabinet, Sir
Henry should make his first public utterance as Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>The importance of raising our question at this
meeting was of course apparent, and we at once
endeavoured to procure tickets of admission. But,
even so early in the fight as this, the Liberals did
not scruple to refuse tickets to women who might
be going to ask awkward questions. On one occasion
just as two tickets were about to be delivered
over to me, I was accused of having questioned
Mr. Asquith at a meeting in the Queen's Hall, and,
though I had really not been present at that meeting,
I was obliged to go away empty-handed. I had
been mistaken for Annie Kenney who had come to
London to attend both the Queen's Hall and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Albert Hall meetings. We both of us thought the
incident most absurd, for we do not in any way
resemble each other. But it put us on our guard,
and when on the very morning of the Albert Hall
meeting, a friend sent me three tickets, we made up
our minds that they should not be rendered useless
by those who presented them being turned away at
the doors. I had been twice interviewed in two
different sets of clothes by the Liberal officials who
had eventually refused me the tickets and Annie herself
had been paraded before a row of stewards; it
was therefore clear that if either of us went to the
meeting we must go disguised. We decided at last
that the three tickets should be used by Theresa
Billington, who had recently joined the Union and
was coming from Manchester for the meeting, by
Annie herself, and by a working woman from the
East End, a recent convert. Nevertheless, we intended
first to give the Prime Minister a chance to
answer fairly, so that no disturbance need be made.
Shortly before the meeting, therefore, Annie Kenney
dispatched by express messenger a letter to Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman on behalf of our Union, asking
him whether the new Government would give
Women the vote, and stating that she should be
in the hall that night in the hope that this important
question would be answered without delay. If this
were not done, she added that she should feel
bound to rise in her place and make a protest.</p>

<p>The next thing to do was to disguise Annie. We
understood that most of the ladies would wear
evening gowns, but it was essential to show as little
of her face, neck, and hair as possible, so, after
dressing her up in a light cream-coloured frock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
we added a fur coat and a thick dark veil. She
told us afterwards that she felt very hot in these
clothes which she was afraid to remove, but, with
the little East End convert walking closely behind
her as her maid, she was allowed by the scrutineers
to pass into a private box which we afterwards found
had been specially set apart for the use of Mr. John
Burns' family and friends.</p>

<p>The immense brilliantly lighted hall was filled
from floor to ceiling. The platform was gaily
decorated with flowers. As the Prime Minister
began to speak Annie Kenney sat anxiously awaiting
his answer, and at last, as he did not give it, she
rose suddenly up and hanging over the edge of the
box a little white calico banner with the words
"Votes for Women" painted upon it in black
letters, she called out in a loud clear voice, "Will
the Liberal Government give women the vote?"
Immediately afterwards came an answering cry from
the opposite end of the hall, and Theresa Billington
let down from the orchestra above the platform a
great banner, nine feet in length inscribed in black
with the words "Will the Liberal Government give
justice to working-women?" For a moment there
was a hush, whilst the people waited for the Prime
Minister's answer, but he and his Cabinet remained
silent. Then the whole vast audience broke into
a tumultuous, conflicting uproar, in the midst of
which the Chairman vainly called for order. The
organ played to drown the women's questions, and
the women were flung out of the hall.</p>

<p>The next day we returned to Manchester for
Christmas to find that Christabel was already planning
a General Election campaign, and all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the holidays, whilst Cabinet Ministers were resting
from their labours, we were busy making white
calico banners, and inscribing them in black letters
with the fateful words, "Votes for Women" and
"Will the Liberal Government give women the
vote?" We had no longer a doubt either that the
new Liberal Government was hostile to our cause
or that it was our duty to fight them until they were
ready to capitulate or to retire from office. Had it
been possible we should have opposed the election
of every candidate running under their auspices, but
as we had neither the funds nor the membership for
so extensive a work, we decided to carry out a definite
Election campaign against one member of
the Government,&mdash;Mr. Winston Churchill. Mr.
Churchill was selected not for any personal feeling
against him, but because he was the most important
of the Liberal candidates who were standing for
constituencies within easy reach of our home.</p>

<p>On the opening night of the campaign Mr.
Churchill had arranged to hold several meetings in
halls in different parts of his constituency and, as the
intentions of the Women's Social and Political Union
were now well-known, considerable excitement and
expectancy prevailed. The first meeting was held
in a school at Cheetham Hill. There were a number
of doors to the meeting room, one opening in
the middle of a side wall and communicating with
a passage leading from the main entrance to the
building; another, a big emergency exit at the back
of the room farthest from the platform, and several
others on each side of the platform opening into
class-rooms and ante-rooms. The first of these
doors was the one by which the audience came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>No tickets were needed and the solitary Suffragette
who presented herself was able to walk
quietly in unnoticed and to take a seat in the middle
of the room. If her heart beat so loud that it
seemed that all must hear it, if she felt sick and
faint with suspense, no one knew.</p>

<p>The whole audience was eagerly looking for "The
lady Suffragists." A party of women in a little
gallery above the door, attracted considerable attention.
"Those are the Suffragists, look up there,"
was whispered from all quarters. A man who sat
next to the unrecognised Suffragette fixed his gaze
upon these ladies, and turning to his companion
said: "That is Miss Pankhurst; she has aged very
much since I saw her last. The ladies have got their
eyes on us; they will begin putting their question
soon." The hall filled up rapidly and at last became
so densely crowded that, owing to the press of
people, the emergency doors at the back of the hall
were burst open and a large crowd collected outside.
Mr. Churchill was late, and during the Chairman's
remarks and the speeches that followed little attention
was paid to what was being said for everyone
was waiting for what was to happen next.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Winston Churchill came in. He
spoke of the unsatisfactory behaviour of the late
Government. The will of the people, he declared,
had been ignored, "But now," he said, "you have
got your chance!" "Yes, we have got our chance,
and we mean to use it. Will the Liberal Government
give women the vote?" The reply came
prompt and sharp as a pistol shot. It was a
woman's voice, and there was a woman standing up
with a little white banner in her hand. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a moment's breathless waiting for Mr. Churchill's
answer which did not come, and then the usual
uproar burst forth. The man who "knew" Miss
Pankhurst was the first to snatch the banner from
the Suffragette, but it was evident that sitting around
her were many unknown friends.</p>

<p>For some time it was impossible to proceed with the
meeting. Whilst the noise was at its height the
interrupter sat down and waited; then, as soon as
quiet was restored and Mr. Churchill attempted to
continue his speech without replying, she again got
up and pressed for an answer to her question. The
Chairman endeavoured to induce Mr. Churchill to
give an answer, but without success. The stewards
threatened to throw the woman out but were afraid
to do so because many of the men showed that they
were prepared to fight for her, and in any case, the
meeting was so crowded that it would have been
difficult to get her through the press of people. The
woman asking for votes seemed likely to have the
best of it for once. Someone suggested that if
Mr. Churchill would only answer, or if the men in
the audience would not get so very much excited,
things might go better, but the advice was unheeded.</p>

<p>At last the Chairman announced that, if the lady
would promise to be quiet afterwards, she should
speak from the platform for five minutes. To this
she was not disposed to agree, but went up to the
foot of the platform to explain that all she wanted
was an answer to her question. Speaking directly
to Mr. Churchill she said, "Don't you understand
what it is I want?" But hiding his face with a
quick impatient movement of his arm he answered
crossly, "Get away, I won't have anything to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
you." Then the Chairman appealed to her: "You
had better come up to the platform," he said, "we
can hear you then; as it is, half the people in the
meeting do not know what all the fuss is about."
She consented, and for the next five minutes tried to
make her explanation, but the enthusiastic Liberals
of the three front rows set up the wildest tumult
of shouts and yells in order to drown her words.</p>

<p>When the five minutes were over the woman
turned to go, but Mr. Churchill seized her roughly
by the arm and forced her to sit down in a chair
at the back of the platform saying, "No, you must
wait here, till you have heard what I have to say,"
then turning to the audience he began complaining of
the way in which the women were treating him and
concluded, "nothing would induce me to vote for
giving women the franchise," and, "I am not going
to be henpecked into a question of such grave importance."
As he finished this declaration of hostility
the men on the platform rose, as if by prearranged
agreement, and the woman questioner stood
up also, wishing to leave. Instantly two men hurried
her to the side of the platform where, screened
from the audience by a group of others, they swung
her roughly over the edge and dragged her into an
ante-room.</p>

<p>Thinking that she was merely to be put outside
she had made no resistance, but now one of the
men went to find the key to lock her in whilst the
other remained in the room, standing with his
back to the door. As soon as they were alone he
began to use the most violent language and, calling
her a cat, gesticulated as though he would scratch
her face with his hands. Knowing that the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was on the ground floor, she ran to the window, and
threw it open, only to find that it was barred. She
called to some people who were passing in the side
street saying: "I want you to be witnesses of anything
that takes place in this room," and they came
running up and shouted to the man to behave himself.
He at once became quieter, and presently on a key
being brought to him, he locked the door and went
away. Now, some of those in the street discovered
that one of the windows had no bars, and they called
to the prisoner to go and open it in order that they
might help her to escape. This was easily done and
an indignation meeting was immediately held on a
piece of waste ground near by. Meanwhile Mr.
Churchill was going on to his other meetings, but
he found a woman readily to question him at every
one.</p>

<p>Next day there were long columns in the Manchester
papers dealing with these incidents whilst
Mr. Churchill's angry assertion that he would not
be "henpecked" drew forth innumerable jokes from
the humorous writers. A verse from one of these,
entitled "The Heckler, and the Hen-pecker, with
apologies to Lewis Carroll" ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i0">"'The price of bread' the Heckler said, 'is what we have to note.</div>
<div class="verse i0">Answer at once, who caused the war, and who made Joseph's coat?'</div>
<div class="verse i0">But here the Hen-pecker, shrieked out, 'Will women have the vote?'</div>
<div class="verse i0">'I weep for you' the Heckler said, 'I deeply sympathise,</div>
<div class="verse i0">We have asked a hundred questions and yet had no replies.'</div>
<div class="verse i0">But here the Hen-pecker spread out a flag of largest size."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Day by day the warfare with Mr. Churchill continued,
a large proportion of the inhabitants of the
district gradually becoming more and more completely
converted to the women's point of view. In
some cases after violent scenes of disorder, the
entire audience got up and left the meeting to show
their sympathy with them.</p>

<p>In our Manchester election campaign we did not
confine ourselves, however, merely to questioning and
Heckling Mr. Churchill. We also held numberless
meetings of our own and distributed thousands of
leaflets.</p>

<p>One day my brother Harry, who was then fifteen
years of age, suggested to us a scheme which,
though it involved some risk of prosecution, we
found irresistible. Accordingly, in the small hours
of the last two mornings before polling, he
and two of his school fellows set off with brush and
paste can and some long narrow slips called "fly
posters," with "Votes for Women" printed in
black letters upon them. Whilst the other two boys
kept a lookout for passing policemen, Harry
pasted these slips cornerwise across Mr. Churchill's
great red and white posters which appeared on
every hoarding in the constituency, just as the
ordinary advertiser does when he wishes to bring
out special points of attraction to heighten the public
interest.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Churchill won the Election, his majority
was smaller than that of any of the other Manchester
Liberal candidates.</p>

<p>One of the most active workers in the new militant
campaign was Mrs. Flora Drummond, a cheery,
rosy-faced little woman, a native of the Island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Arran. As a girl Flora Gibson had been daring
and high-spirited, a good swimmer, a splendid
walker, and the leader in all kinds of out-door sports
and games. On leaving school she successfully
passed all examinations for the position of post mistress,
but immediately afterwards the Post Master
General raised the height standard for all post
masters and mistresses to five feet, two inches, the
same standard being exacted both for men and
women although the average height of men is of
course greater than that of women. Flora Gibson
was only five feet one inch in height, and as it had
been only at considerable sacrifice that her widowed
mother had been able to pay for her education,
poor Flora was in despair; but her father's relations
agreed to pay the necessary fees for her to
learn shorthand and typewriting. She soon became
exceedingly skilled and took a Society of Arts certificate.
Shortly after this she married Mr. Drummond,
a journeyman upholsterer, and removed to
Manchester, his native place. Soon after her marriage
she was obliged to resume her typewriting because
bad trade threw Mr. Drummond out of regular
employment. Eventually she became manager
of the Oliver Typewriter Company's office in Manchester.
She had joined the W. S. P. U. on hearing
of the imprisonment of Annie Kenney and
Christabel Pankhurst.</p>

<p>Mrs. Drummond was invaluable for the work of
questioning Cabinet Ministers which was carried on
continuously in spite of our Manchester election campaign.
When, early in January, 1906, we heard
that the Prime Minister was to speak at the Sun
Hall, Liverpool, she and several other members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the Union agreed to go over and question him. Mr.
Balfour, who was then fighting a losing battle in the
effort to retain his old seat in East Manchester, had
agreed to receive a deputation from our Union.
Nothing very important came of the interview,
though Mr. Balfour's reply was kindly and sympathetic,
but long before Mr. Balfour's hotel had been
reached the deputation had discovered that they were
being shadowed by detectives. As it had been arranged
that some of the women should go straight
on to Liverpool, they made every attempt to shake
off their pursuers. Proceeding first in one direction
and then in another, they were tracked all over
Manchester and Liverpool until finally Christabel
said good-bye to her companions and returned to
Manchester. Then, instead of breaking up into
two parties the detectives all followed her, whilst
the other women, in company with a number of
Liverpool members of our Union, quietly made their
way to the Sun Hall, where nine of them subsequently
questioned the Prime Minister and were all
thrown out of the hall without receiving a reply.
After the first woman had been rejected Sir Campbell-Bannerman
said: "If I might have done so, I
could have calmed that lady's nerves by telling her
that I am in favour of Women's Suffrage," but this,
of course, was no answer to the question as to
whether the Government was prepared to enfranchise
the women of the country.</p>

<p>On January 15th Mrs. Drummond and a number
of her friends in Glasgow attended a meeting of
the Prime Minister's in the St. Andrew's Hall
there. Heckling is a regular institution in Scotland,
and the Glasgow women declared that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
would certainly receive courteous replies. On asking
the usual question Mrs. Drummond was at once
flung out by the stewards and immediately afterwards
one of her companions who had hitherto been
a staunch Liberal approached her with hat awry
and dishevelled clothing saying in bewilderment,
"Oh my, they pet me oot!"</p>

<p>During these weeks questions were also put at
several other meetings including that of Mr. Asquith
in the Sheffield Drill Hall. Everywhere the women
were ejected. On January 25th one of the last big
Liberal meetings of the General Election was held
at Altrincham in Cheshire, Mr. Lloyd George being
the principal speaker. The members of the W. S.
P. U. who were present did not interrupt him during
his speech but waited until he had finished before
asking him the usual question. Mr. Lloyd George
then said: "I was going to congratulate myself that
I had escaped this; however, at the last meeting of
the campaign the spectre has appeared." That was
all, and the women were quickly hauled out to prevent
their again raising their voices.</p>

<p>So the General Election ended, and we were still
left without that pledge from the Liberal leaders
which we had set ourselves to gain. Those of us
who went through the campaign will be ever at a
loss to understand the motives which led the Liberal
leaders to treat our first orderly and considerate
questioning and even the later, more persistent
heckling, as they did. They obviously had neither
the wish nor the intention of giving votes to women
during their term of office, and it was probably the
fear of offending the ladies who canvassed for
them that prevented their plainly saying so. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
after all, they were accustomed to parrying the questioning
of men and it was surely unwise, even from
their own standpoint, to deal so violently with
women.</p>

<p>All that had been done by the new militant suffragists
up to now had been merely the brilliant
skirmishing of an intrepid and resourceful little band
of enthusiasts driven to employ somewhat unconventional
methods, both by the old established custom
of boycotting their cause and by the ruthless
brutality of the forces that were arrayed against
them. Our opponents called us "a stage army"
and "a family party," and the designations were not
inapt, but the little stage army was always cleverly
marshalled, and its soldiers were as cheerfully and
affectionately loyal to the mother of the movement
and to the young general who had initiated the
new tactics as though in reality they had all been
members of a single family.</p>

<p>During the General Election various attempts to
press forward the question of Women's Suffrage had
also been made by the non-militant Suffragists.
Miss Llewellyn Davies and others had organised a
joint Manifesto on this question from a large number
of societies. These included, amongst others,
the Women's Co-operative Guild with 20,700 members,
the Women's Liberal Federation with 76,000
members and the Scottish Women's Liberal Federation
with 15,000 members. The North of England
Weavers' Association, with 100,000. The British
Women's Temperance Association with 109,890
members, the Independent Labour Party with 20,000
members, and the Lancashire and Cheshire Textile
and others Workers' Representation Committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
whose Secretaries were Miss Eva Core-Booth and
Mrs. Sarah Dickinson. The Women Textile Workers'
Committee had also run Mr. Thorley Smith
as a Women's Suffrage candidate for Wigan.
Though Mr. Smith had not been elected, a good fight
had been made and a very creditable vote secured;
the figures had been:&mdash;</p>

<small>JANUARY TO MAY, 1906</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie Kenney Sets off to Rouse London&mdash;The
Scene in the Ladies Gallery and the Deputation
to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>As soon as the General Election was over, we
began to make preparations for the opening of Parliament.
It was decided that the work of our Union
must be carried to London, and that we must have
an Organiser there who would be able to devote
the whole of her time to it. Annie Kenney, who,
after her imprisonment, had never gone back to the
Mill, was chosen for this post. The Election campaign
had put a severe strain upon the resources of
the Union, and from the first the raising of funds
had been our greatest difficulty. Therefore, it was
with only £2 in her pocket and the uncertainty as to
whether more would be forthcoming that Annie
Kenney set off "to rouse London." Perhaps no one
realised what a heavy task, and how many bitter
rebuffs were before this sensitive, fragile girl. I
took a room for her in the house where I was staying
at 45, Park Walk, Chelsea, in order that we
might consult, and as far as possible, work together.</p>

<p>The Committee in Manchester had not formulated
any definite plans of campaign, but we came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
conclusion that we must organise a procession of
women and a demonstration in Trafalgar Square
for the day of the opening of Parliament. When
Annie went to Scotland Yard to inform the police
of our intentions, however, she was told that no
meeting in Trafalgar Square could be allowed whilst
Parliament was sitting. This forced us to the conclusion
that we must hire a Hall somewhere near
Westminster for our meeting place, but we knew not
where to find the money to pay for it. This and
other difficulties, however, were one by one smoothed
away. Mr. Keir Hardie and Mr. Frank Smith
(afterwards elected to the London County Council as
member for Lambeth) were the first to help us,
and they advised us to take the Caxton Hall, Westminster,
and put us in touch with a sympathiser who
agreed to pay the rent of it.</p>

<p>As soon as we had taken the Hall, we drafted a
little handbill to announce the Meeting, and then,
armed with her bills and her wonderful faith in the
goodness of her fellow men and women, Annie
Kenney proceeded with her mission, calling day by day
upon people of whom she knew practically nothing,
and to whom she herself was entirely unknown.
One of those who kindly helped us was Mr. W. T.
Stead, who published in the <i>Review of Reviews</i> a
character sketch of Annie Kenney, in which he
likened her to Josephine Butler. It was soon plain
to us that it would be easier to ask for help if we
formed a London Branch of the W. S. P. U., and
with my aunt, Mrs. Clarke, and Mrs. Lucy Roe,
our landlady, we therefore formed a Preliminary
Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In about a fortnight's time my mother joined us.
She was surprised to learn that so many arrangements
had been made and at first was almost inclined
to be appalled at the boldness of our plans.
She was afraid that we should never induce more
than a handful of women to walk in procession
through the public streets, and that the Caxton Hall
could not be filled. But the die was cast, and she
threw herself into the work determined to do her
very best to prevent failure.</p>

<p>A few days after this we heard that Mrs. Drummond
was coming from Manchester to help us.
Her husband was earning little at the time, and the
Union had no money to provide her railway fare,
but she had walked miles through the snow in order
to collect the necessary funds from her friends.
When she arrived, we were all of us growing very
weary and overwrought. It seemed almost impossible
to stir this great city, filled with its busy
millions who appeared to have no time to think of
anything but their own affairs. The thoughtless
apathy of those whom we met with money and
leisure at their disposal, the dull, hopeless inertia of
those who agreed that we were right, but would not
stir themselves to help, were to us in our anxiety,
almost maddening. But Mrs. Drummond, with her
practical ways and her inexhaustible fund of good
humour, brought with her a spirit of renewed hope
and energy. Her first act was to go to the office
of the Oliver Company and borrow a typewriter
from them. The secretarial duties were thus enormously
lightened, and after rattling off the correspondence
she was always ready to join us in delivering
handbills, canvassing from house to house, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
writing announcements of the forthcoming meetings
with white chalk upon the city pavement.</p>

<p>At last the day of the opening of Parliament,
February 19th, 1906, arrived, and a crowd of some
three or four hundred women, a large proportion of
whom were poor workers from the East End, met
us at St. James' Park District Railway Station. We
formed in procession and put up a few simple banners,
some of which were red with white letters, and
had been made by working people in Canning
Town, whilst the rest I had made of white linen
and lettered with India ink in the little sitting-room
at Park Walk. Our procession had gone but a few
yards when the police came up and insisted upon
the furling of the banners, but they did not prevent
our marching to the Caxton Hall near by. Here
we found that a large audience had already assembled,
and soon the hall was crowded with women,
most of whom were strangers to us. We were told
afterwards that amongst the rest were many ladies
of wealth and position, who, inspired with curiosity
by the newspaper accounts of the disturbances which
we were said to have created, had disguised themselves
in their maids' clothes in order that they
might attend the meeting unrecognised.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pankhurst, Annie Kenney and others who
spoke, were listened to with much earnestness and
presently the news came that the King's speech, the
Government's legislative programme for the session,
had been read, and that it had contained no reference
to the question of Women's Suffrage. My
mother at once moved that the meeting should form
itself into a "Lobbying" Committee and should at
once proceed to the House of Commons in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to induce its members to ballot for a Women's Suffrage
Bill. This resolution was carried with acclamation,
and the whole meeting streamed out into
the street and made its way to the House. It was
bitterly cold and pouring with rain, but when we
arrived at the Strangers' Entrance, we found that
for the first time that anyone could remember, the
door of the House of Commons was closed to
women. Cards were sent in to several Private
Members, some of whom came out and urged that
we should be allowed to enter, but the Government
had given its orders, and the police remained obdurate.
All the women refused to go away, and
permission was finally given for twenty women at
a time to be admitted. Then hour after hour the
women stood outside in the rain waiting for their
turn to enter. Some of them never got into the
House at all, and those who did so went away
gloomy and disappointed for there was not one of
them who had received any assurance that Parliament
intended to give women the vote.</p>

<p>Now, after a chance meeting with Mrs. Pankhurst
and a second long talk with her and with Annie
Kenney, a new recruit had entered our movement.
This was Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, the daughter of
Mr. Henry Pethick, of Weston-super-Mare, and a
member of a Cornish family. As a child at school
she had read the story of Hetty Sorrell in George
Eliot's "Adam Bede," had seen "Faust," and
Marguerite in her prison cell. Later she had learnt
from Sir Walter Besant's <i>Children of Gideon</i> of
the cheerless struggle to eke out an existence upon
starvation wages, which falls to the lot of working-girls.
Then and there she had resolved to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
her life in striving to alter these conditions. She
determined that as soon as she left school she would
go to "the East End," and begin. When the time
came she at once acted upon this decision. Without
seeking help or advice from anyone, she wrote
to Mrs. Hugh Price Hughes, of the West London
Mission and asked that she might be received into
her sisterhood. When her request had been granted
she told her parents of what she had done, and they
readily gave their full approval and sympathy.</p>

<p>After four years of useful training and varied
experiences in the West London Mission, during
which she had had at some times the charge of a
Working-Girls' Club and at others had been sent
out at night on to the London Streets in order to
save and succour the homeless and outcast women
there, she and her friend, Miss Mary Neal, took
rooms in a block of artisans' dwellings and gathered
round them a small colony of social workers. Together
they founded the Esperance Working-Girls'
Club, to which was attached a co-operative dressmaking
establishment, and a holiday hotel at Littlehampton
called "The Green Lady." Later on,
after her marriage Mrs. Pethick Lawrence built a
small cottage near her house at Holmwood called
"The Sundial," where the junior members of the
Esperance Club were invited during the summer.</p>

<p>Writing of these early years, and of her own
decision to take part in the Votes for Women Movement
she says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Out of that part of my life there stand out many memories....
I remember a little girl belonging to the
Children's Happy Evening Club, who went mad with grief
because her widowed mother lost her work, and was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
despair. The dread of being separated in the workhouse
was upon the whole family, and the child was taken to the
asylum, crying, "Poor, poor mother." I remember a girl
about twenty, alone in the world, earning a pittance as
a waitress in a tea-shop. She was a quiet, gentle creature,
who made no complaint. All the greater was the shock
when the girl put an end to her life, leaving a little note,
with the words, "I am tired out." These two cries still
ring out at times in my memory with their terrible indictment
against life as men have made it.... We recognised
the fact that we were only making in a great wilderness
a tiny garden, enclosed by the wall of human fellowship. As
we saw more and more of the evil plight of women, we realised
ever more clearly that nothing could really lift them out
of it until the power had been put into their hands to help
themselves.... Suddenly a light flashed out. News
came of the arrest and imprisonment of Christabel Pankhurst
and Annie Kenney. Here at last was action.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">So it was that Mrs. Pethick Lawrence had prepared
herself to take part in the great Votes for Women
Movement.</p>

<p>We had now decided to organise our London
Committee on a more formal basis. Mrs. Lawrence
was asked to become one of its members and I well
remember her coming to my little room in Park
Walk to take part in the formation of the new Central
Committee. It was the first time I had seen her,
and I can never forget how much I was attracted by
her dark expressive eyes, and the quiet business-like
way in which she listened to what was being said,
only interposing in the debate when she had something
really valuable to suggest. It was later that
I noticed the untrammelled carriage and the fine free
lift of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>That first meeting was towards the end of February
and it was arranged that Mrs. Lawrence, her
friend, Miss Mary Neal, myself, Annie Kenney, my
aunt, Mrs. Clarke, Mrs. Roe, Miss Irene Fenwick
Miller, daughter of a well-known early suffragist,
and Mrs. Martel, of Australia, should form the
London Committee with my mother and Mrs. Drummond,
who were returning to Manchester. It was
decided that I was to become the Honorary Secretary,
and Mrs. Lawrence was asked to be Honorary
Treasurer.</p>

<p>We now felt that our next move must be to secure
an interview with the Prime Minister, and we therefore
wrote to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman asking
him to receive a deputation from our Union.
He replied that he could not spare the time to see
us. Our answer was that, owing to the urgency of
the question, we could take no refusal, and that a
number of our members would call upon him at the
Official Residence, No. 10 Downing Street, on the
morning of March 2nd, 1906.</p>

<p>Downing Street is a short road opening out of
Parliament Street and ending in a flight of steps
leading into St. James' Park. There are now only
three houses left in the Street, the others having
been pulled down to make way for Government
Buildings. The Official Residence itself was not
built for its present purpose and consists of two
comfortable-looking Georgian houses knocked into
one, each of which is three stories high with attics
above, and has three windows along the front of the
first and second floors and two windows and a door
below. The door is dark green, almost black,
and has a black iron knocker, a lion's head with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a ring in its mouth. Above this knocker is a small,
circular, brass knob about half an inch in diameter
and very highly polished and under the knocker is
a brass plate, equally well polished, inscribed "First
Lord of the Treasury." There is one shallow, well
whitened doorstep and on each side of it are black
iron railings that protect the house from the street.
The next house, No. 11, is a slightly more ornate
building in the same style, which was then occupied
by Mr. Herbert Gladstone.</p>

<p>On presenting themselves at the door of the
Official Residence, the deputation from the Women's
Social and Political Union were told that Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman could receive no one, as he
had been ill and was still confined to his room. A
request to see the Prime Minister's secretary was
also refused, and the door was shut. Then, deciding
to wait there until they were attended to, the deputation
sat down to rest on the doorstep and displayed
a little white "Votes for Women" banner.</p>

<p>We had notified the various newspapers<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that we
intended to call on Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
and by this time a number of Press photographers
had collected. This greatly embarrassed
the inhabitants of No. 10, and presently the hall porter
opened the door again, and looking very uncomfortable,
begged the women to go away. Annie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Kenney assured him that she and her companions
would remain all day if need be, and after arguing
for some time, scratching his head and looking very
much puzzled, he finally asked two members of the
deputation to go inside, where they were received by
Mr. Ponsonby, the secretary, who promised to give
their message to his chief.</p>

<p>The same evening we held another Committee
meeting and drafted a further letter to the Prime
Minister asking for an early opportunity of laying
our case before him. In response to this letter, he
returned an evasive reply in which he stated that
any representations that the Union wished to make
to him must be put in writing.</p>

<p>We therefore decided that another attempt must
be made to interview him and after waiting until
he had made a complete recovery and was again
able to take his part in the House of Commons
debates, a larger deputation, consisting of several
members of our Committee and some thirty other
women, made their way to Downing Street about
10 o'clock on the morning of March 9th. They
again asked to see the Prime Minister and the door-keeper
promised to give their message to the secretary.
After they had been waiting for three-quarters
of an hour two men came out and said to
them, "You had better be off; you must not stand
on this doorstep any longer." The women explained
that they were waiting for a reply but were
abruptly told that there was no answer and the door
was rudely shut in their faces.</p>

<p>Angered by this Miss Irene Miller immediately
seized the knocker and rapped sharply at the door.
Then the two men appeared again and one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
called to a policeman on the other side of the road,
"Take this woman in charge." The order was at
once obeyed, and Miss Miller was marched away to
Canon Row Police Station. Spurred on by this
event Mrs. Drummond, exclaiming that nothing
should prevent her from seeing the Prime Minister,
darted forward and pulled at the little brass knob
in the middle of the door. As she did so, she discovered
that the little knob, instead of being a bell,
as she had imagined, was something very different
indeed, for suddenly the door opened wide.
Without more ado she rushed in and headed
straight for the Cabinet Council Chamber, but before
she could get there she was caught, thrown out of the
house and then taken in custody to the police station.
Meanwhile Annie Kenney began to address the gathering
crowd, but the man who had first called the
policeman again looked out and said, "Why don't
you arrest that woman? She is one of the ringleaders.
Take her in charge." Then she was
dragged away to join her companions.</p>

<p>The three women were detained at Canon Row for
about an hour. Then a police inspector told them
that a message to set them at liberty had been sent
by the Prime Minister, who wished them to be informed
that he would receive a deputation from the
Women's Social and Political Union, either individually
or in conjunction with other women's societies.
Of course we published Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's
promise broadcast. Shortly afterwards, two
hundred Members of Parliament, drawn from every
party, petitioned Sir Henry to fix an early date for
receiving some of their number in order that they
might urge upon him the necessity for an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
extension of the franchise to women. He then formally
announced that on May 19th he would receive a
joint deputation both from Members of Parliament
representing the signatories to this petition and all
the organised bodies of women in the country who
were desirous of obtaining the Suffrage.</p>

<p>All the women's societies now began to make preparations
for an effective Demonstration on May 19th.
The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies
decided to hold a meeting in the Exeter Hall, but
we of the Women's Social and Political Union wished
to do something very much more ambitious than that,
and we resolved to organise a procession and a demonstration
in Trafalgar Square. In view of the immense
work that this would entail, we felt the necessity
of engaging another organiser, and my mother
now recommended that Miss Billington should be
asked to undertake the work.</p>

<p>Born in Blackburn in 1877, Theresa Billington,
the daughter of a shipping clerk, had been educated at
a Roman Catholic convent school. Owing to financial
difficulties at home, she had been set to learn
millinery at thirteen years of age. At seventeen she
had made up her mind to be a teacher, and having obtained
one of the Queen's Scholarships, she eventually
became a teacher under the Manchester Education
Committee. When she was first introduced to us she
had come into conflict with the authorities because of
her refusal to give the prescribed religious instruction
to her pupils. My mother, who was then a
member of the Education Committee, intervened to
secure that she should be transferred to a Jewish
school, where she would not be expected to teach
religion, and thus prevented her dismissal. In 1904,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
at my mother's request, she had been appointed as
an organiser for the Independent Labour Party.</p>

<p>About the middle of April, a few weeks after the
Prime Minister had given his promise to receive the
deputation, a Parliamentary vacancy occurred in the
Eye division of Suffolk, and Christabel wrote to our
London Committee, saying that she thought it advisable
that we should go down to the constituency
and intimate to the Liberal candidate that, unless he
could obtain a pledge from his Government to give
Votes to women, we should oppose his return, and
that we should take a similar course in the case of
every future Government nominee. Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence, Annie Kenney and Theresa Billington
therefore went down to Eye and interviewed
Mr. Harold Pearson, the Liberal candidate,
but he treated the question of Votes for
Women with contempt and ridiculed the idea
that women could do anything to hinder his
return. Owing to the size of that large county constituency
and the pressure of work in London these
three members of our Committee then decided to
return to London. But at home in Manchester they
were exceedingly anxious to see the policy of opposition
to the Government at by-elections put into practice.</p>

<p>The funds of the Manchester branch of the Union
were entirely depleted, but five pounds was got together,
an address to the Electors of Eye from the
Women's Social and Political Union was printed and
Mrs. Drummond set off to the constituency to fight
the election single-handed. Five pounds to fight an
election campaign which seems an absurdly small sum
when one realises that the candidates spend many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hundreds. Nevertheless, though she was entirely
friendless and unknown in that part of the country,
Mrs. Drummond succeeded in creating a wonderful
impression. She could not afford to hire a carriage,
it is true, but there was always a friendly farmer or
tradesman who would give the cheery little Scotchwoman
a lift in his cart, and so active was she that in
a short time the impression was spread abroad that
not one solitary Suffragette had gone to Eye, but that
several were working from different centres. Before
the end of the Election the Conservative candidate
and even scornful Mr. Harold Pearson, the Liberal,
had declared in favour of Votes for Women.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Keir Hardie had secured a place
for a Women's Suffrage Resolution which was to be
discussed in the House of Commons on the evening
of April 25th. Though a resolution is only an expression
of opinion and can have no practical legislative
effect, this was considered important because it
was realised that if the new Parliament were to show a
substantial majority in its support, the women's claim
that the Government should deal with the question
would be greatly strengthened. Unfortunately only
a second place had been obtained for the Resolution.
Hence there was every reason to fear that, as so
often before, our talkative opponents would succeed
in preventing its being voted upon. The situation
became more hopeful, however, when the Anti-Vivisectionists,
who had obtained the first place for the
evening, entered into a compromise by which they
agreed to withdraw their resolution early. The way
was thus left clear for the Votes for Women Resolution,
but we ourselves still thought that the "talkers
out" would probably have their way. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
determined not to allow this to happen without protest.
Therefore, in order to be in readiness for any
emergency, a large number of us had obtained tickets
for the Ladies' Gallery.</p>

<p>Looking down through the brass grille, from behind
which women are alone permitted to listen to
the debates in Parliament, we saw that the House
was crowded as is usual only at important crises, and
that both the Government and Opposition front
benches were fully occupied. The Resolution,
"That in the opinion of this House it is desirable
that sex should cease to be a bar to the exercise of
the Parliamentary franchise" was moved and seconded
in short speeches in order that the opponents
should have no least excuse for urging that there had
been no time for their own side to be fairly heard.
Then Mr. Cremer rose to speak in opposition. His
speech was grossly insulting to women and altogether
unworthy of a Member of the People's House of
Representatives. Both by his words, his voice and
gestures he plainly showed his entire view of women
to be degraded and indeed revolting. Yet, though
one was angry with him, he was an object for pity
as he stood there, undersized and poorly made, obviously
in bad health and with that narrow, grovelling
and unimaginative point of view, flaunting
his masculine superiority. The women found it
very difficult to sit quietly listening to him, and,
though my mother strove to check them, some subdued
exclamations caught the Speaker's ear. He immediately
gave orders for the police to be in readiness
to clear the Ladies' Gallery if any further sounds
should issue from it. But, once Mr. Cremer had finished
speaking, absolute quiet was restored. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Willie Redmond, brother of John Redmond, the
leader of the Irish Party, then indignantly protested
against the tone of Mr. Cremer's speech, crying fervently
that he himself had always believed in
Women's Suffrage because, all his life, he had been
opposed to slavery in any form, and declaring that
"any of God's creatures who are denied a voice in the
Government of their country are more or less slaves,"
and that "men have no right to assume that they are
so superior to women, that they alone have the right
to govern."</p>

<p>All through the debate everyone was waiting for
a declaration from the Government. At last Mr.
Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, rose to
speak, but his words were vague and evasive, and
whilst not absolutely excluding the possibility of the
Government's taking the matter up, he certainly made
no promise on their behalf.</p>

<p>At ten minutes to eleven Mr. Samuel Evans rose
with the obvious intention of talking the Resolution
out and, as eleven o'clock, the hour for closing the
debate, drew nearer, whilst spinning out his remarks
by means of some very doubtful jokes, he kept turning
round, every now and then, to look at the clock.
Our eyes were also eagerly fixed upon the timepiece.
Every moment one woman or another stretched across
and asked Mrs. Pankhurst whether the demonstration
of protest should begin, but her answer was always
that there was "time yet," and that we must
wait.</p>

<p>At last someone looked round and saw that the
police were already in the gallery and we realised that
we were to be taken away in order that the Resolution
might be "talked out" without our having an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
opportunity to protest. Irene Miller could no longer
be restrained. She called out loudly, "Divide!
Divide!" as they do in the House of Commons,
and "We refuse to have our Resolution talked out."
Then we all followed suit, and Theresa Billington
thrust a little white flag bearing the words, "Votes
for Women" through the historic grille. It was
a relief to thus give vent to the feelings of indignation
which we had been obliged to stifle during the
whole of the evening, and though we were dragged
roughly out of the gallery, it was with a feeling almost
of triumph that we cried shame upon the men
who had wasted hours in useless talk and pitiful and
pointless jokes with which to insult our countrywomen.</p>

<p>But the rough usage of the police was not by any
means the hardest part of the experience. When we
reached the Lobby, we learnt that our action had
been entirely misunderstood. A number of non-militant
Suffragists were present, and most of these believed,
as the Members of Parliament were telling
them, that, but for our "injudicious" action, a vote
would have been taken upon the Resolution. They
met us with bitter reproaches and disdainful glances,
and even those Members of Parliament who had
proved themselves to be absolutely careless of our
question, now took it upon themselves to come up
and scold us. On all sides we were abused, repudiated
and contemptuously ridiculed, but, after
a few days, public opinion began to turn somewhat
in our favour. It leaked out that the Speaker had
not intended to allow a Resolution calling for the
closure of the debate to be moved, and it therefore
became known that we had judged correctly in thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that the Women's Suffrage motion was to be
talked out.</p>

<p>Writing in the <i>Sussex Daily News</i> for May 2nd,
Mr. Spencer Leigh Hughes, well known under his
pen name "Sub Rosa," recalled the account given
in Lady Mary Montague's "Memoirs" of the way
in which the Peeresses of the eighteenth century had
frequently disturbed the serenity of the House of
Lords debates, and how they had triumphed over
the Lord Chancellor Philip Yorke, First Earl of
Hardwicke, who had attempted to exclude them from
the House of Lords. Lady Mary describes the
"thumping," "rapping" and "running kicks" at
the door of the House of Lords, indulged in by the
Duchess of Queensberry and her friends, the strategy
by which they finally obtained an entry, and the way
in which, during the subsequent debate, they "showed
marks of dislike not only by smiles and winks (which
have always been allowed in these cases), but by
noisy laughs and apparent contempts." Mr. Hughes
ended by saying, "After this excellent and pertinent
account of the action of the Peeresses in the House
of Lords, I suppose no one will be so silly as to
complain of what the women did the other day in
the House of Commons."</p>

<p>Mr. Stead in the <i>Review of Reviews</i> published an
article by a "Woman's Righter," who said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Patience has been tried long enough, and what has it
brought? Less than one ten minutes' expression of the
divine impatience that the Suffragists showed in the Ladies'
Gallery that memorable night!... "Surely it was
unwomanly?" Pshaw! It was not anything like so unwomanly
as it was unmanly to allow a cause admittedly
just to be stifled without a single indignant protest.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, our supporters were still in the minority.
Instead of upholding what we had done to
rebuke the anti-Suffragists for their mean and cowardly
policy of obstruction (a policy which had prevented
the enfranchisement of women for so many
years), the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies
and some of the members of the Parliamentary
Committee, which was at the time engaged in arranging
the deputation to the Prime Minister, now
urged that the Women's Social and Political Union
had disgraced itself too deeply to form part of the
deputation. Efforts were made to induce us to withdraw
from it, but this we refused to do. At last,
both because some Members of Parliament&mdash;and it
is said Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman himself&mdash;strongly
supported our claim to be represented, and
because it was well known that if we were not received
we should simply agitate for another deputation,
the attempt to exclude us had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 19th our procession
started from the Boadicea statue on Westminster
Bridge. First came the members of the Deputation
to the Prime Minister, amongst whom were to be
seen the veteran Suffragist, fragile little Mrs. Wolstenholme
Elmy, with her grey curls, Mrs. Pankhurst,
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, Mr. Keir Hardie, and Annie
Kenney, wearing the clogs and shawl which she had
worn in the Lancashire cotton mill. Amongst the
deputation marched a body of women textile workers
from Lancashire and Cheshire, who had joined us,
carrying the bright banners of their respective trades.
Then came the great red banner of the Women's
Social and Political Union, inscribed in white letters
with the words, "We demand Votes for Women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
this Session." The poles of the banner were lashed
to a big forage lorry in which rode a number of
women, who were either too old or too feeble to
walk. After these came the members of the
Women's Social and Political Union and women
members of various other societies and last of all,
a large contingent from the East End of London,
a piteous band, some of them sweated workers themselves,
others the wives of unemployed working men,
and many of them carrying half-starved-looking babies
in their arms.</p>

<p>The deputation which assembled at the Foreign
Office was introduced by Sir Charles M'Laren, and
it was arranged that there should be eight women
speakers. The first of these was the aged Miss
Emily Davies, LL.D., one of the two women who
in 1866, more than forty years before, had handed
to John Stuart Mill the first petition for Women's
Suffrage ever presented to Parliament, and whose
part in opening the University examinations to
women, and in founding Girton, the first of the
women's colleges, will be gratefully remembered by
women of all ages. In pleading for the removal
of the sex disability Miss Davies said: "We do not
regard it as a survival which nobody minds. We
look upon it as an offence to those primarily concerned,
and an injury to the community." Then
Mrs. Eva M'Laren, Miss Margaret Ashton and
Mrs. Rolland Rainy, representing respectively some
80,000, 99,000 and 14,000 women Liberals in England
and Scotland, urged, each in her own way, that
the Party for which these women had done so much
should extend the franchise to them.</p>

<p>Miss Eva Gore Booth and Mrs. Sarah Dickinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
who had herself been a factory worker for sixteen
years and a Trade Union Organiser for a further
eleven years, then spoke on behalf of the fifty delegates
from the Lancashire and Cheshire Textile and
other Workers' Representation Committee. They
dwelt on the low wages&mdash;often no more than six or
seven shillings a week, and the other heavy economic
hardships under which the women whom they represented
were obliged to labour. They pointed out
that these women, millions of whom since leaving
school had never eaten a meal which they had not
earned, were not only helping to produce the great
wealth of the country but were caring for their homes
and their children at the same time, and urged that
they were every day more gravely conscious of the
heavy disadvantage under which they suffered from
their absolute lack of political power. Industrial
questions were now becoming political questions, they
said, and the vast numbers of women workers had
their point of view and their interests which ought
to be taken into consideration, but which were disregarded
because they were without votes.</p>

<p>Next followed Mrs. Gasson, the speaker for 425
branches and 22,000 members of the Women's Co-operative
Guild. She said that the Co-operative
movement, with its 62,000,000 members and annual
trade of £60,000,000, had often been called a
"State within a State." In that State women had
votes, they attended quarterly business meetings and
voted side by side with men on questions of trade,
employment and education. Women were elected
as directors of Co-operative societies and also on Educational
Committees connected with the Co-operative
movement. And yet the prosperity of the co-operative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"State" continued to increase, although in many
places the women members outnumbered the men.
The Co-operative Guild Women saw that when questions
affecting the Co-operative movement came before
Parliament the movement lost much of its power
because the women had no vote. Unwise or unjust
taxation was injurious to the Co-operative trade, and
women were the chief sufferers by unjust taxation.
Whatever taxes were put upon necessaries men did
not receive larger incomes, and so women had less
to spend. That very month Mr. Birrell had received
Resolutions from large conferences of the Co-operative
Guild members, urging that medical examination
should be made compulsory under the New Education
Bill, but the Resolutions were worth nothing
without a vote behind them. The women who had
sent up these Resolutions felt "like a crying child
outside the door of a locked room, demanding entrance
with no one to open it." Most of the Co-operators
were married working-women. Their
houses were both their workshops and their homes,
and therefore Housing and public Health questions
were especially important to them. Their incomes
were affected by laws relating to trades, accidents,
pensions and all industrial legislation that went to
secure the good health of the workers. Therefore
they appealed that this common right, the right of
a citizen, should be granted to them and to other
women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson spoke on behalf of the Scottish
Christian Union of the British Women's Temperance
Association, with a membership of 52,000 women.
Then Mrs. Mary Bateson presented a petition for
the franchise from 1,530 women graduates, amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
whom were Doctors of Letters, Science and Law in
the Universities of the United Kingdom, the British
Colonies and the United States.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pankhurst spoke for the Women's Social and
Political Union, the militant organisation of which
most of the others were half afraid. She urged on
its behalf that the women of the country should be
enfranchised during that very year, either by a clause
in the Plural Voting Bill then before Parliament,
or by a separate measure. Assuring the Prime Minister
that the members of the Union believed that no
business could be more pressing than this, she stated
calmly and firmly that a growing number of them
felt the question of Votes for Women so deeply that
they were prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice for it
life itself, or what was perhaps even harder, the
means by which they lived. She appealed to the
Government to make such sacrifices needless by doing
this long-delayed act of justice to women without
delay.</p>

<p>Now that the women had all clearly and carefully
laid their case before him, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
rose to reply. He began as though he had
been an earnest and convinced supporter of the
Women's cause and dwelt at length not only upon
the benefits which the franchise would confer upon
them, but also on the enthusiasm which they had
shown in working for it, their fitness to exercise it
and the good work which they had already done in
public affairs. Then, after a long pause, he said:
"That is where you and I are all agreed. It has
been very nice and pleasant hitherto, but now we
come to the question of what I can say to you, not
as expressing my own individual convictions, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
speaking for others, and I have only one thing to
preach to you and that is the virtue of patience."
With hurried hesitating accents he explained that
there were members of his Cabinet who were opposed
to the principle of giving votes to women,
and that, therefore, he must conclude by saying, "It
would never do for me to make any statement or
pledge under these circumstances." Poor blundering
old man, if he really spoke truthfully to the deputation,
one may well pity him in that invidious and
humiliating position.</p>

<p>During Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's last
words there had been a strange silence amongst the
women, and as he resumed his seat a low murmur
of disappointment ran through the room. Mr. Keir
Hardie had been asked by those in charge of the
arrangements to move the vote of thanks to the Prime
Minister for having received the Deputation, and,
though he now performed this duty with characteristic
graciousness of manner, he plainly said that all
present must have suffered great disappointment on
hearing the Prime Minister's concluding statement.
Nevertheless, they were glad to learn that the leaders
of the two great political parties in the House of
Commons were now personally committed to the
question, by Mr. Balfour, a statement he had made
in the House a few evenings before and the Prime
Minister by what he had said that afternoon.
"With agreement between the leaders of the two
great historic parties," Mr. Hardie said gravely,
"and with the support of the other sections of the
House, it surely does not pass the wit of statesmanship
to find ways and means for the enfranchisement
of the women of England before this Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
comes to a close." At this point Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
turned and looked at Mr. Keir
Hardie and solemnly shook his head.</p>

<p>After the resolution had been seconded Mrs. Elmy,
whose name had not been placed upon the authorised
list of speakers, interposed, saying that she had
worked in the cause of Women's Suffrage since October,
1865, and that during that period she had seen
the men voters of the country increased from less
than 700,000 to more than 7,000,000. When the
Reform Act of 1884 had been under consideration,
women Suffragists had been full of hope, but Mr.
Gladstone had refused point blank to give them the
franchise. No Parliament had ever offered a greater
insult to womanhood than the Parliament of that
year, for it had actually taken six or seven divisions
on the point as to whether a criminal should continue
to be disfranchised for more than a year after
his release from prison, but only one division had
been taken to decide that English women should not
exercise the vote. Every year it had become more
and more difficult to remedy the injustices under
which women suffered. "If I were to tell you of
the work of the last twenty years of my life," she
said, "it would be one long story of the necessity
for the immediate enfranchisement of women."</p>

<p>The vote of thanks to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
was then carried with feeble spiritless clapping
and some hisses. Then the Prime Minister
made his reply, but he did not in any way strengthen
his previous declaration and ended by saying that
what women had to do was "to go on converting
the country." As he concluded Annie Kenney suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rose up and cried, "Sir, we are not satisfied,
and the agitation will go on."</p>

<p>Then we dispersed to meet again at three o'clock
in Trafalgar Square. No better meeting place could
have been chosen, for it was here in Trafalgar Square,
that Edmund Beales and the other leaders of the
Reform movement had spoken when the Hyde Park
gates had been closed against them by the authorities
on that historic 23rd of July, 1866, on which the
Park railings were pulled down and the blow struck
which won the Parliamentary vote for the working
men in the towns. It was here, too, that in February,
1886, John Burns had made that speech to the
starving unemployed men of his own class which
caused him to suffer a month's imprisonment and
made him a famous man, and it was here in Trafalgar
Square on the 5th of November, 1887, that, in
taking part in the Demonstration against the imprisonment
of O'Brien and the other Irish leaders, poor
Alfred Linnell had been trampled to death by the
horses of the police.</p>

<p>On this ground, consecrate to the discontented and
the oppressed, under that tall column topped by the
statue of the fighting Nelson and on that wide plinth,
flanked by the four crouching lions, the first big open-air
Women's Suffrage meeting in London was held.
By three o'clock more than 7,000 people had assembled.
I well remember every detail of the scene.
In my mind's eye I can clearly see the Chairman, my
mother, with her pale face, her quiet dark clothes, her
manner, calm as it always is on great occasions, and
her quiet-sounding but far-reaching voice with its
plaintive minor chords. I can see beside her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
strangely diverse group of speakers: Theresa Billington
in her bright blue dress, strongly built and
up-standing, her bare head crowned with those brown
coils of wonderfully abundant hair. I see Keir
Hardie, in his rough brown homespun jacket, with
his deep-set, honest eyes, and his face full of human
kindness, framed by the halo of his silver hair.
Then Mrs. Elmy, fragile, delicate, and wonderfully
sweet, with her face looking like a tiny bit of finely
modelled, finely tinted porcelain, her shining dark-brown
eyes and her long grey curls. Standing very
close to her is Annie Kenney, whose soft bright hair
falls loosely from her vivid sensitive face, and hangs
down her back in a long plait, just as she wore it in
the cotton mill. Over her head she wears a grey
shawl as she did in Lancashire, and pinned to her
white blouse is a brilliant red rosette, showing her
to be one of the marshals of the procession, whilst
her dark-blue serge skirt just shows the steel tips of
her clogs. How beautiful they are, these two women,
as hand clasped in hand they stand before us!&mdash;one
rich in the mellow sweetness of a ripe old age which
crowns a life of long toil for the common good; the
other filled with the ardour of a chivalrous youth;
both dedicated to a great reform. But now, Annie
Kenney speaks. She stands out, a striking, almost
startling, figure, against the blackened stone-work of
the plinth and speaks with a voice that cries out for
the lost childhood, blighted hopes and weary, overburdened
lives of the women workers whom she
knows so well.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MAY TO AUGUST, 1906</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Deputations to Mr. Asquith at Cavendish Square;
Women Arrested and Imprisoned; The By-Elections
at Cockermouth; Adoption of the Anti-Government
Policy.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>As Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had told the
deputation that he could not do anything for us
because some members of his Cabinet were opposed
to Women's Suffrage, we determined to bring special
pressure to bear upon the hostile Ministers, the most
notorious of whom was Mr. Asquith, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Strangely enough, just as we had
decided upon this course of action, we were virtually
advised to adopt it by no less a person than Mr.
Lloyd George, at that time, President of the Board
of Trade. When interrupted by Suffragettes in
Liverpool Mr. George claimed the sympathy of the
audience on the ground that he himself was a believer
in Votes for Women, and said: "Why do they
not go for their enemies? Why do they not go for
their greatest enemy?" At once there was a cry
of "Asquith! Asquith!" from all parts of the
hall, and as Mr. Lloyd George made no attempt
to repudiate the suggestion that he had referred to
Mr. Asquith, it was very generally assumed that he
had done so. An opportunity to "go for" Mr.
Asquith soon presented itself on the occasion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
speaking at Northampton on June 14th. A few
days before the meeting, Theresa Billington and
Annie Kenney visited the town and in a series of open-air
meetings took the people of the place entirely
into their confidence, with the result that Mr. Asquith
was welcomed not by cheering but by hooting crowds.</p>

<p>During the meeting and at the end of his speech
Mr. Asquith was questioned by several women, all
of whom were ejected with the greatest violence,
whilst the audience broke into the now familiar turmoil.
The cowardly and unnecessary brutality shown
to them by the stewards at recent Liberal meetings,
had by this time aroused great indignation amongst
the women. Theresa Billington, who was of strong
and vigorous physique and whose instinct, like that
of every man, was to strike back if she were hit,
had come to feel that she could no longer quietly
endure the disgraceful treatment to which she had
been subjected on several occasions. To this meeting
therefore, she had gone armed with a dogwhip,
the weapon she felt most suitable to employ against
cowardly men. Her intention was not to use it if
she were merely dragged out of the meeting, just
as a man might have been, but only if her assailants
should seek to take advantage of the fact that
she was a woman and should behave in a peculiarly
objectionable way.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Therefore, when the stewards
had torn down her hair and treated her with every
form of indignity and violence, not merely in dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
her from the hall but outside in the corridors
as well, she had pulled out her whip and made a
fairly free use of it.</p>

<p>The general trend of events now made us feel
the necessity of securing a personal interview with
Mr. Asquith, and we therefore wrote asking him to
receive us. He replied that his rule was not to receive
any deputation unconnected with his office of
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and we then wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent center"><span class="smcap">To the Right Hon. H. H. Asquith, Chancellor of
the Exchequer.</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>Sir</i>:</p>

<p>I am instructed by my Committee to say that the subject
of the enfranchisement of women, which they desire to lay
before you, is intimately bound up with the duties of your
office. Upon no member of the Cabinet have women greater
claims than upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Your
Budget is estimated on a system of taxation which includes
women. Women not being exempt from taxation have a
right to claim from you a hearing. Women are told that
you are mainly responsible for the refusal of the Prime
Minister to deal with their claim. But being convinced of
the justice of giving votes to women they renew their request
that you receive a deputation on an early date in
order that their case may be presented to you.</p>

<p>Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">E. Sylvia Pankhurst</span>.</p>

<p>Hon. Sec. of the London Committee of the Women's Social
and Political Union 45, Park Walk, Chelsea, S.W.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Asquith returned no answer to this our
second letter, and therefore, without making any further
attempt to obtain his consent, we wrote to him
saying that a small deputation would call at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
house, No. 20 Cavendish Square, on the morning of
Tuesday, June 19th. On the appointed day the
women arrived just before 10 o'clock in the morning,
but, early as it was, they were told that
Mr. Asquith had already gone to the Treasury.
They thereupon decided that half their number
should wait on the doorstep and that the other half
should go to look for him. Those who went to the
Treasury were told that Mr. Asquith had not arrived,
and those who remained on guard at his house
were equally unsuccessful, for whilst they had been
standing there waiting, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
had escaped through the back door in a
closed motor car.</p>

<p>Our determination to meet Mr. Asquith face to
face was still strong, and after our failure to see
him on the Tuesday we at once wrote to say that
we were sending a larger deputation to interview
him in two days' time. We had now three flourishing
branches of the Union in London, one in the
centre and two in the East End, and some thirty or
forty representatives, partly drawn from these
branches and partly from our central Committee,
formed the deputation.</p>

<p>Carrying little white Votes-for-Women flags and
headed by Theresa Billington, some thirty of the East
End members marched off in procession for Mr. Asquith's
house; but on arriving at the edge of Cavendish
Square, they were met by a strong force of police
who told them that they must at once turn back.
The poor women stood still in affright, but would
not turn. Then the police fell upon them and began
to strike and push them and to snatch their flags
away. Theresa Billington tried in vain to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this violence, "We will go forward," she cried.
"You shall not hit our women like that," but a
policeman struck her in the face with his fist and
another pinioned her arms. Then she was seized by
the throat and forced against the railings until, as
was described by an onlooker, "she became blue
in the face." She struggled as hard as she could to
free herself but was dragged away to the police
station with the East End workers following in her
train.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Annie Kenney, with a
number of others, most of whom were members of
our Committee, came into the Square. Annie knew
nothing of what had taken place and, preoccupied
and intent on her mission, she walked quickly across
the road, but, as she mounted the steps of Mr.
Asquith's house and stretched out her hand to ring
his bell, a policeman seized her roughly by the arm
and she found herself under arrest. Following
this, Mrs. Knight, one of the East End workers, who,
because she suffered from hip disease had felt that
she could not walk in the procession, came into the
Square and crossed the road. On seeing none of the
other women she concluded that they had already
gone into Mr. Asquith's house. She intended to
join them but, just as she was about to step on to
the pavement opposite No. 20, she was roughly
pushed off the curb-stone by a policeman and arrested
as soon as she attempted to take another step
forward. Mrs. Sparborough, a respectable elderly
woman dressed with scrupulous neatness in worn
black garments, who by the work of her needle supported
herself and her aged husband, stood watching
this scene in deep distress. Noticing that two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
maid servants and some ladies at the window of
Mr. Asquith's house were laughing and clapping
their hands, she turned to them protesting gravely:
"Oh, don't do that. Oh, don't do that. It is a
serious matter. That is how <i>the soldiers were sent
to Featherstone</i>."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A policeman immediately
pounced upon her and dragged her away.</p>

<p>At the police court afterwards Theresa Billington,
on being charged with an assault upon the police,
refused either to give evidence or to call witnesses in
her defence, saying that she objected to being tried
by a court composed entirely of men and under laws
in the framing of which men alone had been consulted.
Her plea was abruptly swept aside and she
was ordered to pay a fine of £10 or in default to go
to prison for two months.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Miss Billington chose imprisonment, but her resolution
was balked by "an anonymous reader of the
<i>Daily Mirror</i>," who handed the amount of her fine
to the Governor of Holloway Gaol.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The charges of disorderly conduct against the
other three women were adjourned until July 14th.</p>

<p>Every charge against the prisoners, except that
of being in Cavendish Square with the object of
seeing Mr. Asquith broke down, but Mr. Paul
Taylor, the magistrate, who seemed quite incapable
even of trying to understand their motives, decided
that they had created an obstruction and ordered
them to enter into their own recognisances in the
sum of £50 and to find one surety for the same
amount, to be of good behaviour and to keep the
peace for twelve months. In the event of their not
finding such sureties and consenting to be so bound
over he ordered that they should be sent to prison
for six weeks.</p>

<p>To agree to be bound over to keep the peace would
have been both an admission of wrongdoing and a
promise to refrain from similar methods of agitation.
Rather than this Annie Kenney preferred to suffer
a second imprisonment and the other women, though
they had but recently joined the Union and though
many friends urged that they had already done good
work and might now fairly return to their homes,
decided that they too would go to gaol.</p>

<p>In the meantime there were stirring doings in
Manchester. On June 23rd there had been a great
Liberal Demonstration at the Zoological Gardens,
Belle View, on the outskirts of the town, where Mr.
Lloyd George, Mr. John Burns and Mr. Churchill
had been the principal speakers. Representatives of
the Women's Social and Political Union had been
present to question the Cabinet Minister and had
been thrown out as soon as they had raised their
voices. In the scuffle Mr. Morrissey, a Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
city councillor, intervened to protect his wife from
the violence of the stewards and was very roughly
used. As the Suffragettes were flung by the stewards
into the public road outside they were ordered to
move on by the police and because Mr. Morrissey,
whose leg had been seriously injured by his assailants,
was unable to walk away, he was arrested.
Seeing this my youngest sister, Adela, then scarcely
out of her teens, and only about five feet in height,
expostulated with one of the constables and in doing
so laid her hand upon his arm, saying, "Surely you
can see that Mr. Morrissey cannot walk!" But
at that she was accused of attempting to effect a
rescue, and was also taken into custody. The councillor's
wife and a friend, who both offered similar
protests, were treated in the same way. The case
of these four people came up in Manchester simultaneously
with that of Annie Kenney and her comrades
in London, with the result that Adela was committed
to prison for a week on refusing to pay a
fine<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of five shillings and costs whilst Mrs. Morrissey
and Mrs. Mitchell on refusing to be bound over to
keep the peace were imprisoned for three days. Of
course this punishment was for daring to urge an
unwelcome question upon Members of the Government,
but as this was not a punishable act the
charges of disorderly conduct outside in the road had
been trumped up.</p>

<p>The question of these trials was raised in the
House of Commons by Mr. Keir Hardie, who declared
that it was stretching the law too far to forbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a deputation to approach a private house. He
also pointed out that Mr. James Kendall, one of
the magistrates who had tried the case of the Manchester
Suffragettes, and had been Chief Steward at
the Liberal meeting from which they had been
ejected, Mr. Cremer and Mr. Maddison both delivered
vindictive speeches against the Suffragettes,
the former describing the sentence passed upon
them as "extremely lenient" and the latter referring
to them as "female hooligans." The more
sensational and less reputable of the newspapers
adopted a similar line speaking of the women as
"Kenney," "Knight" and "Sparborough," calling
them "mock martyrs" and "martyrettes" and
publishing hideous and libellous drawings of them.
Even the staider and more serious periodicals gave
one-sided and biassed accounts of what had taken
place, rebuking the Suffragettes for what they
termed their "disgraceful behaviour," telling them
that they were "ruining" their cause, and urging
them to save it by returning to "Constitutional" and
"orderly" methods of propaganda.</p>

<p>The following interesting and valuable letter
to the press from Mr. T. D. Benson, the Treasurer
of the Independent Labour Party cleverly exposed
the hypocrisy of these strictures:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><i>Dear Sir</i>:</p>

<p>Having had, through illness, plenty of time on my hands
this last week, I have made a calculation of the number of
years which the lady Suffragettes have put back their movement.
I find that it amounts to somewhat about 235 years.
The realisation therefore, of their aims is, according to this
mode of chronology, as far off in the future as the Plague
and the Fire of London are in the past. Nevertheless, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
shall not be surprised if they succeed within the next twelve
months, or two or three years at the most.</p>

<p>Of course, when men wanted the franchise, they did not
behave in the unruly manner of our feminine friends. They
were perfectly constitutional in their agitation. In Bristol
I find they only burnt the Mansion House, the Custom
House, the Bishop's Palace, the Excise Office, three prisons,
four toll-houses, and forty-two private dwellings and warehouses,
and all in a perfectly constitutional and respectable
manner. Numerous constitutional fires took place in the
neighbourhoods of Bedford, Cambridge, Canterbury and
Devizes. Four men were respectably hanged at Bristol and
three in Nottingham. The Bishop of Lichfield was nearly
killed, and the Archbishop of Canterbury was insulted,
spat upon, and with great difficulty rescued from amongst
the yells and execrations of a violent and angry mob. The
Suffragists in those days had a constitutional weakness for
Bishops, and a savage vandalism towards cathedrals and
bishops' palaces. A general strike was proposed, and secret
arming and drilling commenced in most of the great Chartist
centres. Wales broke out even into active rebellion, and
nine men were condemned to death. At London, Bradford,
York, Sheffield, Liverpool, Chester, Taunton, Durham and
many other towns long sentences of penal servitude were
passed. In this way the males set a splendid example of
constitutional methods in agitating for the franchise. I
think we are well qualified to advise the Suffragettes to
follow our example, to be respectable and peaceful in their
methods like we were, and then they will have our sympathy
and support.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">T. D. Benson</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The day after the trial Mrs. Pethick Lawrence
received from Annie Kenney a little note hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
scribbled in pencil and posted by some kind-hearted
person just as she was being taken away from the
Police Court cell. "I am writing this," it read,
"before going in the van. I am very happy and
I shall keep up and be brave and true, and when I
come out I shall be fully prepared to do anything the
Union asks of me."</p>

<p>As yet most of us knew little of the interior of a
prison, but, on those burning July days, we knew
enough to think with sorrow and anxiety of our
comrades shut away from the beauty of the summer
in the heat of their small, stifling cells. We heard
with joy that they were happy and contented to
suffer imprisonment for the women's cause.</p>

<p>And now it seemed to us as though the spirit of
revolt against oppression were flowing onward and
spreading, like some great tide to all the womanhood
of the world. We read of that wonderful
Marie Spiridonova, the Russian girl who after enduring
the most incredible and unspeakable torture
and dying in the agony of her wounds, was yet
upborne by the greatness of the cause for which she
suffered, and cried with her last breath, "Mother,
I die of joy." The movement towards liberty then
springing up amongst the women of the Far East
also inspired us. We read of the words of one of
the Korean women leaders who said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women of our country are the most pitiable of all
civilised humanity.... They are enclosed like prisoners,
bottled up like fish. But we must remember that
after the cock crows the dawn comes, and after work there
is reward. Should we but put forth together our feeble
efforts a way will be found of accomplishing our object
and women will gradually be able to stand in the shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
light of the sun and to breathe the sweet heavenly air
freely and happily.</p>
</div>

<p>News of the Women's cry for freedom came to
us from North, South, East and West, and we
felt ourselves part of a Universal movement. We
were keyed up to any sacrifice. We felt that the
fate of other women depended upon us. We knew
that our battle to overcome the first and greatest
barrier&mdash;to obtain political liberty&mdash;was to be a
sharp one. We hoped it would be short. We
heard that on June 14th, but a month before our
women had gone to prison, the women of Finland
had gained their vote. We believed then that the
franchise would be won for British women within
a few months' time.</p>

<p>Very soon after Annie Kenney, Mrs. Knight and
Mrs. Sparborough had gone to prison, another opportunity
occurred for our Union to strike a blow at
the Government, for it was announced that there was
to be a by-election; this time at Cockermouth. Christabel
was at first the only member of the Union
free to take part in the Election. She at once introduced
an entirely new departure in electioneering tactics
by hiring a stall in the market-place, where she
sold Votes-for-Women literature. When, by this
means she had collected a sufficient crowd around her,
she mounted a stool and addressed the people, explaining
to the electors that she wished them to vote
against the Liberal candidate in order to show the
Government that they did not approve of its refusal
to give votes to women. After a time other
women joined her and the little band of Suffragettes
made a considerable impression upon the people of
Cockermouth, who had heard of the imprisonments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in London and Manchester and who were deeply
moved by learning that women were prepared thus
to fight and to suffer for their cause. When on
August 3rd, the poll was declared, it was found
that the Liberals had lost the seat which had long
been held for them by Sir Wilfred Lawson, and that
Sir John Randles, the Unionist candidate had been
returned by a majority of 690. The figures being:</p>

<p>The Votes at the General Election had been:</p>

  <tr>

    <td class="tdr tdb">4,784</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Probably because the Liberal nominee against
whom she was working had been returned to Parliament,
and also because she had been single-handed,
Mrs. Drummond's campaign at Eye had passed almost
unnoticed outside the constituency itself. At
Cockermouth, on the other hand, the Liberal had
been defeated, and so it naturally followed that all
the influences that had led to his defeat were carefully
analysed by the politicians and the Press.
Some of the members of the Women's Social and
Political Union had formerly been Liberals and
though the Liberal leaders steadfastly declared that
the action of women could make no possible difference
to the situation, they were very deeply incensed
by the thought that women should dare to
put the question of their own enfranchisement before
every other consideration and, instead of seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to win the Government's favour as they had
done in the past, should prefer attempting to force
those in power to attend to their claims.</p>

<p>To a man the politicians were surprised. "Who
would have dreamt," they said, "that women could
be so selfish?" Though their candidate, Mr.
Robert Smillie, had not been attacked, the Labour
men were also discontented, for there were Labour
women in the Women's Social and Political Union,
and they considered that these particular women
ought to have been working directly for the Labour
Party and not to have been subordinating its interests
to the getting of votes for themselves. The
Conservatives meanwhile said very little about the
matter, for their candidate had won and having,
therefore, no reason to be aggrieved, they contented
themselves with declaring that a glorious
victory had been won for the cause of Tariff Reform.</p>

<p>So much for the politicians. The Party-following
Press, with scarcely an exception, had been
unanimous from the very first in their hostility to
the Women's Social and Political Union and its
methods. Now, as before, they either shook their
heads at us, expressing sorrow and regret that we
should place ourselves in opposition to the "forces
of progress," or merely professed amusement that
we should be so foolish and conceited as to think
that anything that we could say or do would influence
elections.</p>

<p>Timid and half-hearted friends of the Suffrage
movement also condemned the new by-election policy
on the ground that it was unwise for women to thus
oppose the Government that had the power, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wished, to give them what they asked. All this,
of course, was to be expected, and so was comparatively
easy to meet&mdash;it is what every true reformer
has had to face. But even amongst some of those
who had been hitherto the warmest supporters of
the Suffragettes and all that they had done, there was
much heart-searching and heart-burning because of
the independent by-election policy, and it was felt
by these that a mistake was being made in thus
holding aloof from Men's party organisations and
counting as nought the opinions of private Members
of Parliament. The W. S. P. U. pointed out to
them that a large majority of the private Members
in the House of Commons had long been pledged
to give their support to Women's Suffrage but that
these pledges had been useless. This was due in
the first place to the fact that private Members had
little power to carry their pledges into effect because
practically all the time at the disposal of Parliament
was taken up by the Government, and that, as had
been done on the 29th of April, a few obstructionists
could easily block the question unless the party in
power were prepared to find further time for it.
Besides this, private members had over and over
again shown that they would willingly break the
pledges they had made to women at the bidding
of their party leaders.</p>

<p>But these explanations failed to reassure many
faint-hearted doubters, for though they agreed that
in theory the independent policy was well enough,
they felt convinced that in practice it was doomed
to fail. They freely admitted that the women, by
their clever speeches and the undeniable justice of
their cause, would be almost certain to convince the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
electors that they were in the right, but they urged
that the British elector was a hard-headed individual,
who could never be induced to throw aside his party
politics and to cast his vote on this one issue alone,
especially as this issue was a women's question that
did not directly affect him.</p>

<p>So these critics agreed that the policy would "be
possible with an electorate of heroes, but not with
average men." For this reason it must fail.</p>

<p>But in spite of these gloomy predictions the
Women's Social and Political Union held to its
course, and did not swerve one hair's-breadth from
the plan of campaign that it had laid down.</p>

<p>An anti-Government election policy has frequently
been employed by men politicians; notably
by the Irish under Parnell. In the course of the
agitation for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases
Acts, Mrs. Josephine Butler and her colleagues
fought the Government at many by-elections, but
with that exception an anti-Government by-election
policy had never been adopted by women. In following
it out now, when many members, even of
our own Committee doubted its wisdom, and few
were really enthusiastic in its favour, Christabel
Pankhurst, its originator in this case, gave evidence
of that keen political insight and that indomitable
courage and determination which are so essential to
real leadership, and which have since enabled her to
steer the Suffragette ship through so many dangerous
shoals and quicksands.</p>

<p>On August 14th the three Suffragettes, "Mr.
Asquith's Prisoners," as they had been called, were
released from Holloway. They were all cheerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and bravely uncomplaining. Mrs. Knight and
Annie Kenney were both white and feeble-looking
but only spoke of their anxiety to be of service to
the cause, whilst Mrs. Sparborough, though she had
got rheumatism through being made to scrub the
stone floor of her cell without a kneeler, made light
of the imprisonment, saying that she had felt peaceful
and happy and had sung hymns to herself to
drive her loneliness away.</p>

<p>And now great meetings of welcome to the prisoners
were being held in London and Provincial
campaigns were being organised in various parts of
the country. Everywhere that the fiery torch of
zeal and enthusiasm was carried there was warm
sympathy from the masses of the people and the
slumbering desire for enfranchisement amongst all
classes of women began to awake. Mrs. Lawrence
was holding a series of fine meetings in Yorkshire.
Annie Kenney, after addressing vast and enthusiastic
crowds in Lancashire, made her way up to Scotland
and with Theresa Billington went on to Mr.
Asquith's constituency of East Fife. Aroused by
their speeches the women here demanded that The
Chancellor of the Exchequer should receive them in
deputation. He judged it wisest to consent, but
protected himself from meeting the two ex-prisoners
by stipulating that only residents in the constituency
should be present. In his reply to this deputation
he declared himself to be still an opponent of their
cause. "Then there is no hope for women?" asked
one of them; but he only answered "Women must
work out their own salvation."</p>

<p>In Wales the flag of the W. S. P. U. was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hoisted by Mary Gawthorpe,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> another new recruit,
a winsome, merry little creature, with bright hair
and laughing hazel eyes, a face fresh and sweet
as a flower, the dainty ways of a little bird, and
having with all so shrewd a tongue and so sparkling
a fund of repartee, that she held dumb with astonished
admiration, vast crowds of big, slow-thinking
workmen and succeeded in winning to good-tempered
appreciation the stubbornest opponents.
Whilst she was in his constituency, it was announced
that Mr. Samuel Evans who had "talked out" the
Votes-for-Women resolution on the twenty-ninth of
April, and who was now appointed a Law Officer
of the Crown, was coming to speak to his constituents.
Miss Gawthorpe determined to talk him out
as he had "talked out" the Women's resolution.
She therefore attended two of his meetings and at
the first of these was dragged out by the stewards,
but at the second a strong force of men gathered
round to protect her and insisted that she should be
heard. The Chairman then tried to checkmate her
by playing the Welsh National Anthem, but little
Mary won all hearts by leading off the singing,
and so poor a figure did Mr. Samuel Evans cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that Mrs. Evans was said to have declared that next
time there was a Women's Suffrage debate in the
House of Commons she should keep her husband
at home.</p>

<p>In London the work was being organised by Christabel,
who amongst other things was conducting an
active campaign in Battersea, the constituency represented
by Mr. John Burns, the President of the
Local Government Board. The income of the
Union was still very small, and everything had to
be done with the strictest possible economy. The
money for meetings in halls was only forthcoming on
very special occasions, and wherever possible the
expenses of printing and advertising were curtailed.
A large number of meetings were held at street
corners, with a chair borrowed from a neighbouring
shop as platform, and, in order to collect a crowd,
my sister started the custom of ringing a large muffin
bell. One of those who had been greatly impressed
by the work of our Union was Miss Elizabeth
Robins, the novelist, whose impressions of these
early days of the movement are so graphically described
in her novel, <i>The Convert</i>.</p>

<p>The following extract from this book is a very
truthful picture of a typical Battersea meeting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In Battersea you go into some modest little restaurant,
and you say, "Will you lend me a chair?" This is a surprise
for the restaurateur.... Ernestine carries the
chair into the road and plants it in front of the fire station.
Usually there are two or three helpers. Sometimes Ernestine
if you please, carries the meeting entirely on her own
shoulders&mdash;those same shoulders being about so wide. Yes,
she is quite a little thing. If there are helpers she sends
them up and down the street sowing a fresh crop of handbills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
When Ernestine is ready to begin she stands on
that chair in the open street and, as if she were doing the
most natural thing in the world, she begins ringing that
dinner bell. Naturally people stop and stare and draw
nearer. Ernestine tells me that Battersea has got so used
now to the ding-dong and to associating it with "our meetings,"
that as far off as they hear it the inhabitants say,
"It's the Suffragettes, come along." And from one street
and another the people emerge laughing and running. Of
course, as soon as there is a little crowd that attracts some
more, and so the snowball grows.... Last night she
was wonderful.... When she wound up "The motion
is carried; the meeting is over!" and climbed down
off her perch, the mob cheered and pressed round her so
close that I had to give up trying to join her. I extricated
myself and crossed the street. She is so little that unless
she is on a chair she is swallowed up. For a long time
I could not see her. I did not know whether she was
taking the names and addresses of the people who wanted
to join the Union, or whether she had slipped away and
gone home, till I saw practically the whole crowd moving
off with her up the street. I followed for some distance
on the off side. She went calmly on her way&mdash;a tiny
figure in a long grey coat between two "helpers," a Lancashire
cotton spinner and the Cockney working-woman and
that immense tail of boys and men (and a few women)
all following after&mdash;quite quiet and well-behaved&mdash;just
following because it didn't occur to them to do anything
else. In a way she was still exercising her hold over her
meeting. I saw presently there was one person in front
of her; a great big fellow who looked like a carter. He
was carrying home the chair.... Oh, if you could
only see her! Trudging along, apparently quite oblivious
of her quaint following, dinner bell in one hand, leather
case piled high with leaflets on the other arm. Some of
the leaflets sliding off and tumbling onto the pavement.
Then dozens of hands helped her to recover her property....</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>OCTOBER TO NOVEMBER, 1906</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">A Protest Meeting in the Lobby of the House of
Commons. Eleven Women go to Prison. What
it is Like in Holloway Gaol.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>On October 3rd, 1906, Parliament re-assembled
for the Autumn session. A large number of our
women made their way to the House of Commons
on that day, but the Government had again given
orders that only twenty women at a time were to be
allowed in the Lobby. All women of the working
class were rigorously excluded. My mother and
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence were amongst those who succeeded
in gaining an entrance. They at once sent in
for the Chief Liberal Whip and requested him to
ask the Prime Minister, on their behalf, whether he
proposed to do anything to enfranchise the women
of the country during the session, either by including
the registration of qualified women in the provisions
of the Plural Voting Bill then before the House, or
by any other means. The Liberal Whip soon returned
with a refusal from the Government to hold
out the very faintest hope that the vote would be
given women at any time during their term of
office.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Mrs. Pankhurst and Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence returned to their comrades and consulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with them. The women had received a direct rebuff,
and they felt that they must now act in such a way
as to prove that the Suffragettes would no longer
quietly submit to this perpetual ignoring of their
claims. They therefore decided to hold a meeting
of protest, not outside in the street, but just there,
in the Lobby of the House of Commons&mdash;of all
places the most effective one for women to choose
for a meeting, because the nearest within their reach
to that legislative Chamber which had so frequently
refused to grant them the franchise. Once made,
the resolution was acted upon without delay. Mary
Gawthorpe mounted one of the settees close to the
statue of Sir Stafford Northcote and began to address
the crowd of visitors who were waiting to interview
various Members of Parliament. The other
women closed up around her, but in the twinkling of
an eye dozens of policemen sprang forward, tore
the tiny creature from her post and swiftly rushed
her out of the Lobby. Instantly Mrs. Despard, a
sister of General French, a tall, ascetic-looking, grey-haired
figure, stepped into the breach; but she also
was roughly dragged away. Then followed Mrs.
Cobden Sanderson, a daughter of Richard Cobden,
and many others, but each in her turn was thrust outside
and the order was given to clear the Lobby.
Mrs. Pankhurst was thrown to the ground in the
outer entrance hall and many of the women, thinking
that she was seriously hurt, closed round her refusing
to leave her side. Crowds were now collecting in
the roadway and the women who had been flung
out of the House attempted to address them but
were hurled away.</p>

<p>Annie Kenney, who had scarcely recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the effects of her last imprisonment, had been told
by the Committee that she must not take any part in
the demonstration for fear that she should be again
arrested. She agreed to run no risks, but she could
not keep entirely away from the scene of action and,
standing on the other side of the road, was now
watching to see what might befall her comrades. In
the midst of the struggle she noticed that Mrs.
Pethick Lawrence was being roughly handled, and
impulsively ran forward to ask her if she were hurt.
Being already well known to the police, she was immediately
arrested. Mrs. Lawrence was greatly
distressed and cried out, "You shall not take this
girl; she has done nothing." But the only result
of her protest was that she herself was also taken
into custody. Before long seven women had shared
the same fate, including Miss Irene Miller, my sister
Adela Pankhurst, and Mrs. How Martyn, B.Sc.,
who had recently become Honorary Secretary of the
London Committee of the Women's Social and Political
Union.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the poor women who had
marched from the East End and who had been denied
admission to the Lobby, were resting their tired
limbs on the stone benches in the long entrance hall,
and after Mrs. Cobden Sanderson had made her
attempt to speak and had been hustled away, she
seated herself quietly beside these women and began
to talk with them. Shortly afterwards a young policeman
came up and abruptly ordered her away and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as she did not go he seized her and dragged her to
the police station.</p>

<p>The next morning the women were brought up at
Rochester Row Police Court before Mr. Horace
Smith. Mrs. Cobden Sanderson's sisters, Mrs. Cobden
Unwin and Mrs. Cobden Sickert and several
friends and relatives of the other women, had come
early in order that they might be sure of obtaining
a seat in Court. Whilst another trial was in progress
the Usher had asked them to leave the Court for
the present in order to make room for other people,
saying, "You shall be allowed in again when your
own case comes on." They at once acceded to his
request, but were prevented from returning and were
subsequently told that no women would be allowed
to enter. Some twenty or thirty of us had by this
time congregated in the large entrance hall, but,
though men were constantly passing in and out of
the Court where the trial was taking place, admittance
was denied to us. Many of us wished to testify
as witnesses, but we were told that we could not
go into the Court, and were taken into a side room,
where an attempt was made to lock us in. To prevent
this, we insisted upon standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>In the meantime the case against the ten Suffragists
was being hurried through. They were all put
into the dock together. After the police evidence
had been heard against them, Mrs. Cobden Sanderson
asked leave to make a statement. You must
not picture her to yourself as being either big-boned,
plain-looking and aggressive and wearing "mannish"
clothes, or as emotional and overstrung. On the
contrary, she is just what Reynolds, Hoppner, Sir
Henry Raeburn, or Romney with his softest and tenderest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
touch, would have loved to paint. Not very
tall, she is comfortably and firmly knit and as she
walks she puts her foot down quite firmly, in a dignified
and stately way. She is always dressed in low-toned
greys and lilacs, and her clothes are gracefully
and delicately wrought, with all sorts of tiny tuckings
and finishings which give a suggestion of daintiest
detail without any loss of simplicity or breadth. She
has a shower of hair like spun silver that crinkles itself
in the most original and charming way, and which she
binds around with broad ribbon, lest its loose falling
strands should mar the neatness of her aspect. Her
cheeks are tinged with the soft dull rose that one
sees in pastel, and her eyes have the most genial and
benevolent glance.</p>

<p>Speaking now to the Magistrate, she said, quite
quietly, that she had gone to the House of Commons
to demand the vote; that so long as women
were deprived of citizen rights and had, therefore,
no constitutional means of obtaining redress,
they had a right to be heard in the House of
Commons itself. She wished to take the whole responsibility
of the demonstration upon her own
shoulders. "If anyone is guilty," she said, "it is
I. I was arrested as one of the ringleaders, and
being the eldest of these, I was most responsible."
Then she quoted in her defence the words of Mr.
John Burns, who was now the President of the Local
Government Board and who, in circumstances similar
to those in which she was placed, had said, "I
am a rebel because I am an outlaw. I am a law-breaker
because I desire to be a law-maker."</p>

<p>At this point the Magistrate, who had repeatedly
interrupted her, refused to hear any more, or to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
any statement at all from the other prisoners,
although in doing so, he was disregarding every legal
precedent. He said that each of the ten defendants
must enter into her own recognisances to keep the
peace for six months and must find a surety for her
good behaviour in £10, and that if she failed to do
this, she must go to prison for two months in the
second division. The women at once protested
against this mockery of a trial, and raising a banner
bearing the words "Women should vote for the laws
they obey and the taxes they pay" declared that they
would not leave the dock until they had been allowed
the right to which all prisoners were entitled, namely
that of making a statement in their own defence.
But Mr. Horace Smith cared nothing for the justice
of what they said; he merely called the police and the
women were forcibly removed.</p>

<p>The Police Court authorities now announced to
those of us who were waiting in the witness room
that the case was over and that our friends had been
taken to Holloway. I can scarcely express our feelings
of indignation. It seemed, indeed, terrible that
ten upright, earnest women should have been thus
hustled off to prison, without a word from their
friends, after a trial lasting less than half an hour.</p>

<p>Some protesting, others filled with silent consternation,
the women turned to go, but I, myself, felt
that I could not leave without a single word of rebuke
to those who had conducted the proceedings
against us so shamefully. I therefore returned to
the door of the inner court and asked to be admitted.
"It is all over," said the doorkeepers, "there is
nothing to interest you now;" but I walked quickly
past them and entered the court. It was quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
small room; one could easily make oneself heard without
raising one's voice, and as shortly as I could, I
told the magistrate how women had been refused
admittance whilst the trial was in progress, and how
some who had actually taken their seats had been
tricked into leaving. I pointed out to him that as it
was customary to allow the general public, and especially
friends of the prisoners, to be present in
court, it was grossly unfair to refuse to do so in this
case, and likely to destroy confidence in the justice
of the trial. I was explaining that even the women
who had wished to testify as voluntary witnesses had
been kept out of the court, when the magistrate interrupted
me saying, "There is no truth in any of
your statements. The court was crowded."</p>

<p>I was then seized by two policemen, dragged across
the outer lobby and flung into the street. Here a
great mass of people had assembled and I felt that
I ought not to go away without telling them something
of the cause for which we were fighting and
of the very scanty justice which had been doled out
to our women. I tried to speak to them, though I
had been rendered almost breathless by the violent
manner of my ejection, and only to those who were
near me could I make myself heard. In a moment,
I hardly knew how or why, I was again seized by the
policeman and dragged back into the court house.
Soon afterwards I found myself in the dock before
Mr. Horace Smith, and was charged with causing an
obstruction and with the use of violent and abusive
language. I protested against the latter half of the
charge and it was immediately withdrawn. At
greater length than on the first occasion, I was then
able to describe all that had happened within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
precincts of the court. Many of our friends and
members, on hearing that all was not over, had returned
and from amongst them I called as witnesses
to the truth of my statement, Mrs. Cobden Unwin,
Mrs. Cobden Sickert and a number of other ladies,
but their testimony was ignored and I was found
guilty and sentenced either to pay a fine of £1 or
to undergo fourteen days' imprisonment in the third
and lowest class. Of course I chose the latter alternative,
and was taken to join my comrades in the
cells. But now, instead of being ordered away as
before, our friends were allowed to come up and
bring us lunch and talk to us for a little while.</p>

<p>The police court cells were small and dark, furnished
only with a wooden seat fastened to the wall
and a sanitary convenience. The walls were whitewashed,
the floors were of stone, and each of the
cells opened into a long stone passage, whose barred
windows overlooked the courtyard, beyond which
we could see through gaps in the prison buildings,
the crowds of people who were assembled in the
street beyond. We were not shut up in the cells
but allowed to move about from one to another, or
to stand in the passage, at the end of which were
several stone steps leading up to a strongly-fastened
iron gate. This passage, though dimly lit, was
lighter than the cells and seemed to us less insanitary,
and so as we had many hours to wait before we
were to be taken to Holloway in the prison van,
"Black Maria," we seated ourselves together on the
stone steps. Someone had brought with her a volume
of Browning, and Mrs. Lawrence read aloud
to us from those of the poems which seemed to apply
to our own case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>All too soon the order came for us to go down to
the van and, one by one, as our names were called,
we walked across the yard, climbed the steps and
took our places separately in one of the twelve little
compartments which it contained. I was one of
the two last to enter, and I had, therefore, a little
more of the fresh air than most of the others, and
from the small barred window of my compartment,
I could see the burly form of the guarding policeman
who stood in the passageway between us and, when
he moved from time to time, could see past him and
out the barred window in the door of the van to the
streets through which we drove.</p>

<p>How long the way seemed to Holloway, as the
springless van rattled over the stones and constantly
bumped us against the narrow wooden pens in which
we sat! As it passed down the poor streets, the
people cheered&mdash;they always cheer the prison van.
It was evening when we arrived at our destination,
and the darkness was closing in. As we passed in
single file through the great gates, we found ourselves
at the end of a long corridor with cubicles on
either side. A woman officer in holland dress, with
a dark blue bonnet, with hanging strings on her head
and with a bundle of keys and chains jangling at her
waist, called out our names and the length of our
sentences and locked each of us separately into one
of the cubicles, which were about four feet square
and quite dark. In the door of each cubicle was a
little round glass spy-hole, which might be closed by
a metal flap on the outside. Mine had been left
open by mistake, and through it I could see a little
of what was going on outside.</p>

<p>Once we had been locked away, the wardress came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from door to door, taking down further particulars
as to the profession, religion, and so on, of each
prisoner&mdash;there were many beside ourselves&mdash;and
asking if we and they could read and write and sew.
Meanwhile the prisoners called to each other over
the tops of the cubicles in loud, high-pitched voices.
Every now and then the officer protested, but still
the noise continued. Soon another van load of
prisoners arrived and the cubicles being filled, several
women together were put into the same compartment,&mdash;sometimes
as many as five in one of those
tiny places! It was very cold, and the stone floor
made one's feet colder still, yet for a long time&mdash;until
I was so tired that I could no longer stand&mdash;I
was afraid to sit down because, in the darkness,
one could not see whether, as one feared, everything
might be covered with vermin.</p>

<p>After waiting a long time, the prisoners were sent
to see the doctor, and we Suffragists stood waiting in
a line together. The wardress passed constantly up
and down our ranks saying, "All of you unfasten
your chests." When at last we got into the doctor's
room, he either asked us no questions, or said in a
mechanical way, "Are you all right?" then he
touched us quickly with his stethoscope and we passed
back to our cubicles.</p>

<p>After another long wait we were sent to change
our clothes. In a large room, lined with shelves,
with two or three wardresses hovering about, and
one seated at a table, we were told to undress, three
or four at a time, and given a short cotton chemise
to put on after we had removed our own clothes.
Then we were ordered to hand over our clothes,
hats, dresses, boots and all together, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
roughly tied up in bundles and placed upon the
shelves. Then, barefooted, and wearing only the
chemise, we were made to march across to the officer
at the table. The officer now told us to deliver to
her our money, jewellery, hair pins and hair combs.
She gave us back the hair pins and kept everything
else, taking down particulars of these and entering
them in a book. At the same time she again asked
us our names, ages, and the other particulars which
we had now given so often. After this we were
searched; the officer first telling us to put up our
arms, and then feeling us all over and examining
our hair to see that we had nothing concealed about
us. A wardress then led us through a doorway into
the dimly lit bath room.</p>

<p>The baths were separated from each other by partitions,
and from the rest of the room by a half door
which had no fastening and over which the wardress
could look. The baths were of black iron, covered
with an old and very dingy coat of white paint,
which had worn off in patches and the woodwork
which enclosed them was stained and worn. I
shrank from entering the bath, but I was shivering
with cold, and though I feared it was not clean, there
was something comforting about the feel of the warm
water. Presently the wardress hung some towels
and underclothing over the top of the wooden door,
and told me to dress as quickly as I could. I hastened
to obey her, and found that the clothes, which
were badly sewn and badly cut, were of coarse calico
and harsh woollen stuff, and that there were innumerable
strings to fasten around one's waist. A
strange-looking pair of corsets was supplied to each
of us, but these we were not obliged to wear unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
we wished. The stockings were of harsh thick wool,
and had been badly darned. They were black with
red stripes going around the legs, and as they were
very wide, and there were no garters or suspenders
to keep them up, they were constantly slipping down
and wrinkling around one's ankles.</p>

<p>On opening my door I found that outside all was
hurry and confusion. In the dim light the women
were scrambling for the dresses, which were lying in
big heaps on the floor. The skirts of these dresses,
like the petticoats&mdash;of which there were three&mdash;were
of the same width at both top and bottom and
they were gathered into wide bands which, though
fastened with tapes were not made to draw up, and
had to be overlapped in the most clumsy fashion in
order to make them fit any but the very stoutest
women. The bodices were so strangely cut that even
when worn by very thin people they seemed bound
to gape in front, especially as they were fastened
with only one button at the neck. My bodice, the
only one I could manage to get hold of, had several
large rents, which had been roughly cobbled together
with black cotton.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Every article of clothing was
conspicuously stamped with the broad arrow, which
was painted black on light garments, and white on
those which were dark.</p>

<p>I had scarcely fastened my dress when somebody
called out to us all: "Look sharp and put on your
shoes." These we had to take for ourselves from
where they were bundled together on a wooden rack.
None of them seemed to be in pairs and they were
heavy and clumsy, with leather laces that, when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
attempted to tie them, broke easily in the hand.
Lastly, white cotton caps fastened under the chin
with strings and stamped in black with the broad
arrow, and the blue and white check aprons and handkerchiefs,
both of which looked like dusters,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> were
given to us and we were led off on a long journey
to the cells.</p>

<p>It seemed a sort of skeleton building that we were
taken through&mdash;the strangest place in which I had
ever been. In every great oblong ward or block
through which we passed, though there were many
stories, one could see right down to the basement
and up to the lofty roof. The stone floors of the
corridors lined the walls all the way round, jutting
out at the junctions of the stories like shelves some
nine or ten feet apart, being protected on the outer
edge by an iron wire trellis work four or five feet high,
and having on the wall side rows and rows and rows
of numbered doors studded with nails. The various
stories were connected by flights of iron steps bordered
by iron trellis work, and reaching in slanting
lines from corridor to corridor. All the walls and
doors were painted stone colour and all the iron
work was painted black.</p>

<p>We clattered up those seemingly endless flights and
shuffled along those mazy corridors in our heavy
shoes and at last stopped at a small office, rather
like one of the pay desks which one sees in drapers'
shops, where our names and the length of our sentences
and all the various other particulars were
verified once more, and the sheets for the bed, a
Bible and a number of other little books with black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
shiny bindings, were given out to us. Annie Kenney
had told us that a tooth brush would be given to us
if we asked for it, but that if we neglected to do this,
nothing would be said about it, and we might not be
allowed to have it later. As we waited in line I
noticed that the other women were eating chunks of
brown bread,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but, though by this time I was very
hungry, none had been given to me. I asked Mrs.
Baldock, who stood next to me, where she had got
her bread, and she told me that one of the wardresses
had given it to her, and seeing that I had been
overlooked, she broke off half her own small loaf
and gave it to me. These were the last words I
was to have with my fellow prisoners, for, whilst
they had been put into the second class, I had been
sentenced to the third, and even in chapel they were
hidden from me by a buttress.</p>

<p>After another long march through the prison corridors,
a wardress, with her jangling keys, unlocked a
number of heavy iron doors and having ordered each
of us to enter one of them separately, shut them
behind us again with a loud bang. I now found
myself in a small whitewashed cell twelve or thirteen
feet long by seven feet wide, and about nine feet
high. The floor was of stone. The window,
which was high up near the ceiling had many little
panes, enclosed in a heavy iron frame-work and
guarded by strong iron bars outside. The iron door
was studded with nails and its round eye-like spy-hole
was now covered on the outside. On the left-hand
side of the door was a small recess, some four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
feet from the ground, in which, behind a pane of
thick opaque glass was a flickering gas jet which cast a
dim light into the cell. Under this recess was a
small wooden shelf, somewhere about fourteen or
fifteen inches square, which I afterwards learnt was
called the table, and opposite this was a wooden
stool. By the window, set into the corner of the
room, was another shelf about three feet six inches
high, with one about six inches from the floor immediately
under it. The lower shelf was for the
mattress and bedding. The upper one held a
wooden spoon, a pint pot of block tin stamped with
the broad arrow, a wooden saltcellar, a small piece
of hard yellow soap, a red card case containing some
prison rules and a card on which was printed a morning
and an evening prayer, a small oval hair brush
without a handle, like a good-sized nail brush, and
a comb between three and four inches long. On
this shelf I was afterwards told to place my books
and tooth brush. These things had all to be kept
in certain never varying positions. On the floor,
leaning against the wall under the window, were arranged
a number of utensils made of block tin, these
being a plate, a small water can holding about three
pints of water, a tiny shallow wash-basin less than a
foot in diameter, and a small slop-pail with a lid.
Two little round brushes, in shape rather like those
we use for brushing clothes with, which were intended
for sweeping the floor, a little tin dust pan,
and a piece of bath-brick wrapped in some rags for
cleaning the tins. These also were all placed in an
order which, as I soon learnt, was never to be
changed. A small towel and a smaller table cloth,
both of them resembling dish cloths, hung on a nail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Propped against the right-hand wall was the plank
bed, with the pillow balanced on top. The bed is,
I think, two feet six inches in width, and when in
position for sleeping is raised up by two cross pieces
to about two inches from the floor.</p>

<p>As I was examining in wonder all these various
things, a wardress opened the door and said sharply,
"What, have you not made your bed yet? The
light will be put out soon. You had better make
haste!" "Please can I have a nightdress?"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I
asked, but she answered "No." Then the iron door
banged and I was left alone for the night.</p>

<p>After eating my little piece of bread, I did as I
was told and tried to sleep. But sleep is one of the
hardest things to obtain in Holloway. The bed is
so hard, the blankets and sheets are scarcely wide
enough to cover one, and the pillow, filled with a
kind of herb, seems as if it were made of stone.
The window is not made to open. The system of
ventilation is exceedingly bad, and though one is
usually cold at night one always suffers terribly from
the want of air.</p>

<p>I learnt next day that we were as yet only in the
admission cells, and as everyone was too busy to set
us to work we had nothing to do but examine our
books. These I found, in addition to the prayer
book, consisted of a Bible, a hymn book, a tract
called "The Narrow Way," which was intended to
show how easy it is to fall into temptation, and a
little book on health and cleanliness, which described
the way in which human beings are gradually poisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
when they were not able to get enough fresh
air.</p>

<p>The following day we were removed to the cells
which we were to occupy during the remainder of
our imprisonment. Many of the ordinary cells are
exactly like the reception cells, but the cell into which
I was now put was smaller, but better lit than the
reception cell, for it had a larger window and there
was a small electric light bulb attached to the wall
instead of the recessed gas jet. Hanging on a nail
in the wall was a large round badge made of yellow
cloth bearing the number of the cell and the letter
and the number of its block in the prison. I was
told to attach this badge to a button on my bodice,
and henceforth, like the other prisoners, I was called
by the number of my cell, which happened to be
twelve.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Suppose yourself to be one of the Third Class
prisoners. Like them you will follow the same routine.
Each morning whilst it is still quite dark you
will be awakened by the tramp of heavy feet and
the ringing of bells; then the light is turned on.
You wash in the tiny basin and dress hurriedly.
Soon you hear the rattle of keys and the noise of
iron doors. The sound comes nearer and nearer
until it reaches your own door. The wardress flings
it open and orders sharply, "Empty your slops,
12!" You hasten to do so, and return at the word
of command.</p>

<p>Then, just as you have been shown, you roll your
bed. The first sheet is folded in four, then spread
out on the floor, and rolled up from one end, tightly,
like a sausage. The second sheet is rolled round it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and round this, one by one, the blankets and quilt.
You must be careful to do this very neatly or you
are certain to be reprimanded.</p>

<p>Next clean your tins. You have three pieces of
rag with which to do this. Two of them are
frayed scraps of brown serge, like your dress, and
the other is a piece of white calico. These rags
were probably not new and fresh when you came
here, but had been well used by previous occupants
of the cell. Folded up in these rags you will find
a piece of bath-brick. You have been told to rub
this bath-brick on the stone floor until you have
scoured off a quantity of its dust. Then you take
one of the brown rags and soap this on the yellow
cake which you use for your own face. Then with
the soapy rag you rub over one of the tins, and this
done, dip the rag into the brick-dust which is lying
on the floor and rub it on to the soapy tin. Then
you rub it again with the second brown rag and
polish with the white calico one that remains. You
must be sure to make all the tins very bright.</p>

<p>Presently the door opens and shuts again. Someone
has left you a pail of water; with it you must
scrub the stool, bed and table, and wash the shelves.
Then scrub the floor. All this ought to be done
before breakfast, but unless you are already experienced
in such matters it will take you very much
longer.</p>

<p>Before you have done your task there comes again
the jangling of keys and clanging of iron doors.
Then, "Where's your pint, 12?" You hand it
out, spread your little cloth and set your plate ready.
Your pint pot is filled with gruel (oatmeal and water
without any seasoning), and six ounces of bread are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
thrust upon your plate. Then the door closes.
Now eat your breakfast, and then, if your cleaning
is done, begin to sew. Perhaps it is a sheet you have
to do. Of these, with hem top and bottom and
mid-seam, the minimum quantity which you must
finish, as you will learn from your "Labour Card"
is 15 per week.</p>

<p>At half past eight it is time for chapel. The
officer watches you take your place in line amongst the
other women. They all wear numbered badges like
yours, and are dressed as you are. A few, very few,
four or five perhaps, out of all the hundreds in the
Third Division, wear red stars on caps and sleeves.
This is to show that they are first offenders who
have previously borne a good character and have
someone to testify to that fact. Every now and
then the wardress cries out that someone is speaking,
and as you march along there is a running fire of
criticism and rebuke. "Tie up your cap string, 27.
You look like a cinder-picker. You must learn to
dress decently here." "Hold up your head, number
30." "Hurry up, 23." In the chapel it is your
turn. "Don't look about you, 12." In comes the
clergyman. He reads the lessons and all sing and
pray together.</p>

<p>Can they be really criminals, all these poor, sad-faced
women? How soft their hearts are! How
easily they are moved! If there is a word in the
services which touches the experience of their lives,
they are in tears at once. Anything about children,
home, affection, a word of pity for the sinner, or of
striving to do better,&mdash;any of these things they feel
deeply. Singing and the sound of the organ make
them cry. Many of them are old, with shrunken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cheeks and scant white hair. Few seem young. All
are anxious and careworn. They are broken down
by poverty, sorrow and overwork. Think of them
going back to sit, each in her lonely cell, to brood
for hours on the causes which brought her here,
wondering what is happening to those she loves outside,
tortured, perhaps, by the thought that she is
needed there. How can these women bear the slow-going,
lonely hours? Now go back to your cell
with their faces in your eyes.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock comes dinner. A pint of oatmeal
porridge and six ounces of bread three days a
week, six ounces of suet pudding and six ounces of
bread two days a week, and on two other days eight
ounces of potatoes and six ounces of bread.</p>

<p>After dinner you will leave your cell no more
that day, except to fetch water between two and three
o'clock, unless it be one of the three days a week on
which you are sent to exercise. In that case, having
chosen one for yourself from a bundle of drab-coloured
capes, and having fastened your badge to it,
you follow the other women outside. There, all
march slowly round in single file with a distance of
three or four yards between each prisoner. Two of
the very oldest women, who can only totter along, go
up and down at one side, passing and repassing each
other.</p>

<p>If you came into the prison on Wednesday, the
first day for you to exercise will be Saturday. How
long it seems since you were last in the outside world,
since you saw the sky and the sunshine and felt the
pure fresh air against your cheek! How vividly
everything strikes you now. Every detail stands out
in your mind with never-to-be-forgotten clearness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Perhaps it is a showery Autumn day. The blue sky
is flecked with quickly driving clouds. The sun
shines brightly and lights up the puddles on the
ground and the raindrops still hanging from the
eaves and window ledges. The wind comes in little
playful gusts. The free pigeons are flying about in
happy confidence. You notice every variation in
their glossy plumage. Some are grey with purple
throats, some have black markings on their wings,
some are a pale brown colour, some nearly white;
one is a deep purple, almost black, with shining white
bars on his wings and tail. All are varied&mdash;no
two are alike. The gaunt prison buildings surround
everything, but in all this shimmering brightness, in
this sweet, free air, they have lost for the moment
their gloomy terror.</p>

<p>Now, your eye lights on your fellow prisoners.
You are brought back to the dreary truth of prison
life. With measured tread, and dull listless step,
they shuffle on. Their heads are bent, their eyes
cast down. They do not see the sun and the brightness,
the precious sky or the hovering birds. They
do not even see the ground at their feet, for they pass
over sunk stones, through wet and mud, though
there be dry ground on either side. The prison
system has eaten into their hearts. They have lost
hope, and the sight of nature has no power to make
them glad. It may be that when next you walk
with them you will feel as they do. These gloomy
overshadowing walls and the remembrance of your
narrow cell, with its endless twilight and dreary,
useless tasks may have filled your mind and driven
away all other thoughts.</p>

<p>Once inside, the last break in the day will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
supper at five o'clock (like breakfast, six ounces of
bread and a pint of gruel), except that just before
the light goes out at night, comes a noisy knocking
at every door, and the cry, "Are you all right?"
Then darkness, a long, sleepless night, and the
awakening to another day like yesterday and like
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="no-indent center large"><span class="smcap">Further Arrests. The "Mud March."</span></p>


<p class="p1_25">Whilst their comrades were in Holloway, the
W. S. P. U. members were putting forth redoubled
efforts to press forward the work outside. A manifesto
explaining the objects of our movement and
calling upon the women of the country to stand by
those who had gone to prison and to fight with them
to secure enfranchisement was posted upon the walls
and circulated broadcast as a leaflet. This appeal
met with a far readier response than any that had
yet been made. Amongst people of all parties, there
was a growing feeling that the imprisoned Suffragettes
should receive the treatment due to political
offenders. The Liberals, large numbers of whom
knew her personally, found an especial difficulty in
reconciling themselves to the idea that Richard
Cobden's daughter should be thrown into prison and
treated by a Liberal government as though she had
been a drunkard or a pickpocket. Mr. Keir Hardie,
Lord Robert Cecil and others, raised the matter in
the House of Commons, and drew comparisons between
our lot and that of the Jameson raiders, Mr.
W. T. Stead and others who had been imprisoned
for political reasons. In reply to this, Mr. Gladstone,
the Home Secretary, began by saying that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
had no power to take action. On October 28th,
however, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence left Holloway
owing to serious illness. On the following day,
Mrs. Montefiore was also released for the same reason,
and a day or two afterwards it became known
that Mrs. How Martyn and Mrs. Baldock had been
removed to the prison hospital. Protests against the
treatment of the Suffragettes daily became more and
more insistent, and at last, on October 31st, Mr.
Herbert Gladstone changed his mind and ordered,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
or as he put it, "intimated his desire" that the Suffrage
prisoners should be transferred to the first class.</p>

<p>On the eighth day of our imprisonment my cell
door was flung open suddenly and the Matron announced
that an order had come from the Home
Office to say that I was to be transferred to the
first class. I was then hurriedly bustled out of my
cell and a few minutes afterwards as, in charge of
a wardress, I was staggering along the passage carrying
my brush and comb, the sheets that I was hemming,
and all my bed linen, I met my comrades
going in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>We were ushered into a row of rather dark cells
adjoining each other in an old part of the prison,
which is chiefly occupied by prisoners on remand who
have not yet been tried. These women, we were
horrified to find, are treated exactly like second class
prisoners, except that their dress is blue instead of
green, and that some to whom permission has been
given are allowed to wear their own clothes, and
to have food sent in to them at their own expense.
We were now offered the same privileges, but these
we declined. On consulting the prison rules, however,
I found that first class misdemeanants are entitled
to exercise their profession whilst in prison,
if their doing so does not interfere with the ordinary
prison regulations. I therefore applied to the Governor
to be allowed to have pen, pencils, ink and
paper, and after a day's waiting my request was
granted. For me prison had now lost the worst of
its terrors because I had congenial work to do.</p>

<p>We were now able to write and to receive a letter
once a fortnight, and to have books and one newspaper
a day sent in by our friends. The food served
out to us was exactly like that of the second class
except that instead of oatmeal gruel, a pint of tea
was substituted for breakfast and a pint of cocoa
for supper. As the second class is that into which
the majority of the Suffragettes have been relegated,
it is useful to give the table of dinners here.</p>

<p><i>Monday</i>, 8 oz. haricot beans, 1 oz. fat bacon, 8
oz. potatoes, 6 oz. bread.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 1 pt. soup, 8 oz. potatoes, 6 oz. bread.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 8 oz. suet pudding (exactly like
that served in the third class), 6 oz. bread, 8 oz.
potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>, 6 oz. bread, 8 oz. potatoes, 3 oz. cooked
meat&mdash;a kind of stew.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, Soup 1 pt., 6 oz bread, 8 oz. potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, Suet pudding 8 oz., bread 6 oz., potatoes
8 oz.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>, bread 6 oz., potatoes 8 oz., 3 oz. meat
"preserved by heat" <i>i. e.</i>, some kind of preserved
meat slightly warmed.</p>

<p>The soups or meat for each prisoner was served
in a cylindrical quart tin into the top of which, like
a lid, was fitted another shallow tin holding the potatoes.
One did not clean these tins oneself as one did
the other utensils, and probably because the kitchen
attendants were overburdened with work, they were
always exceedingly dingy and dirty-looking. Everything
was as badly cooked and as uninviting as it could
be. The cocoa, which was quite unlike any cocoa
that I have ever tasted, had little pieces of meat and
fat floating about in it. It was evidently made in
the same vessel in which the meat was cooked. To
cut up our meat, in addition to the wooden spoon,
which is common to the second and third classes, we
were now provided with "a knife." This knife was
made of tin. It was about four inches in length and
Mrs. Drummond later on aptly described it as being
"hemmed" at the edge. There was no fork.</p>

<p>On November 6th my sentence came to an end,
and the newspaper representatives were all eager to
hear from me what the inside of Holloway was like.
I was thus able to make known exactly what the conditions
of imprisonment had been both before and
after our transfer to the first division and to show
that even under the new conditions, the treatment of
the Suffragettes was very much more rigorous than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that applied to men political prisoners in this and
other countries.</p>

<p>Next day, November 7th, Mr. Keir Hardie introduced
a Women's Suffrage Bill into the House of
Commons under "the ten minutes rule." It had
only two chances of passing into law; the first that
the Government should provide time for it and the
second that not one single Member of Parliament
should oppose it in any of its stages. The Government
refused to give the time, and the second chance
was destroyed by a Liberal Member, Mr. Julius
Bertram.</p>

<p>On November 19th another demonstration was
therefore held outside the House of Commons as
a result of which Miss Alice Milne of Manchester
was arrested, and imprisoned for one week. Public
sympathy was still daily turning more and more to
the side of the Suffragettes and when a by-election
became necessary at Huddersfield, Mr. Herbert
Gladstone decided to release Mrs. Cobden Sanderson
and her colleagues, though they had served but half
their sentences and, on November 24th they were
set free after one month's imprisonment. They
were not only welcomed with enthusiasm by their
fellow militant Suffragettes, but a dinner was given
in their honour by the older non-militant Suffragists
at the Savoy Hotel.</p>

<p>Believing that it was to the Huddersfield by-election
that they owed their unexpected freedom, a
number of the released prisoners at once hurried off
to the constituency where Mrs. Pankhurst and a
band of other women were strenuously working
against the Government and had already become
the most popular people in the election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the train by which the prisoners arrived
was more than two hours late, they were welcomed
at the station by cheering crowds, and found that a
great meeting of women, which had been called for
the due time of their arrival, was still patiently waiting
to hear them speak.</p>

<p>The three candidates, Liberal, Unionist and
Labour were now, because of its extraordinary popularity,
all anxious to be known as supporters of
Women's Suffrage and they went about wearing the
white Votes for Women buttons of the W. S. P. U.
Mr. Sherwell, the Liberal, tried to sidetrack the
Suffragettes' appeal to the electors to vote against
him because he was the nominee of the Government,
by constantly announcing that he was in favour of
Women's Suffrage, and that the Liberal Party was
the best of all parties for women. The following
handbill issued from his committee rooms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">"<i>MEN OF HUDDERSFIELD, DON'T BE
MISLED BY SOCIALISTS, SUFFRAGETTES,
OR TORIES.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>VOTE FOR SHERWELL.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>Polling took place on November 28th, and when
the votes were counted, it was found that the Liberal
poll as recorded at the General Election had been
reduced by 540. The figures were:&mdash;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Government had been pushing on
with its Bill for the abolition of plural voting, to
which the Women's Social and Political Union had
persistently claimed that a clause providing for the
registration of qualified women voters should be
added. When the Bill reached the Report stage
on November 26th, Lord Robert Cecil moved and
Mr. Keir Hardie seconded and Mr. Balfour supported
an amendment to postpone the operation of the
Bill until after the next General Election, unless in
the meantime the franchise had been given to women
on the same terms as men. The object was, of
course, to call attention to the need of Votes for
Women, and this somewhat round-about way had
been adopted because it was ruled out of order to
simply suggest that votes for Women should be enacted
as a part of the Plural Voting Bill. The
amendment was opposed by the Government, and
defeated by 278 votes to 50.</p>

<p>Our Manchester Members were now anxious to
organise a protest on their own account and it was
agreed that they should have their way. Accordingly,
on December 13th, a valiant little army of
some twenty or thirty North Country women came
down to London and proceeded straight to Parliament
Square, carrying a small wooden packing case
which they set down in the gutter opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
stranger's entrance. The box was mounted by Mrs.
Jennie Baines of Stockport, a fragile little woman,
who had begun her strenuous life as a Birmingham
child home-worker, rising early in the morning in
order to help her mother to stitch hooks and eyes
on to cards before going to school, snatching a few
moments for the same task in the dinner hour and
on returning home in the evening, working far into
the night. In her girlhood she had been a Salvation
Army "Captain." Later she had married a journeyman
bootmaker, and though, in addition to caring
for her home and her children, she had been
forced to toil in the factory, in order to keep the
home together, she had still managed to work as a
Police Court Missionary and Temperance and Social
reformer.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was with the knowledge born of
much experience, that Mrs. Baines now pleaded for
the enfranchisement of her sex. Within a few
moments a strong force of police came hurrying up
and she was roughly dragged down and hustled
away. Her place was instantly taken by Mrs.
Morrissey of Manchester, whilst the other women
linked arms and pressed closely round to form a
guard, but after a short hard struggle the police
broke through, tore the speaker from the box, and
made five arrests. One woman was thrown to the
ground and lay unconscious, and Mrs. August MacDougal,
an Australian,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> knelt on the ground beside
her, raised her head and held a cup of water to her
lips. Then a heavy hand was laid upon Mrs. MacDougal's
shoulder and a rough voice ordered her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
go, but she remained to attend to the injured woman.
For this offence she was arrested, whilst Mrs.
Knight, the woman who had been hurt, was removed
to Westminster Hospital.</p>

<p>Next day the five women who had been taken into
custody were at Westminster Police Court each ordered
by Mr. Horace Smith either to pay a fine of
twenty shillings or to go to prison for fourteen days,
in the first class. They all chose the latter alternative
and were taken to the cells. Two days afterwards
some of our members attempted to hold a
meeting in the Strangers' Lobby. As a result of this
eleven of them were sent off to join their comrades
in gaol for fourteen days.</p>

<p>Still the Government refused to withdraw their
hostility to votes for women, Parliament remained
apathetic, and still the majority of the general public
were content to allow things to remain as they
were. Therefore we felt that yet another protest
must be made before the year 1906 should come to
an end, and on December 20th, the eve of Parliament's
rising for the Christmas holidays, Mrs. Drummond,
who had now settled in London, organised a
third attack upon the House. Whilst her followers
were attempting to speak in the Lobby, she succeeded
in entering the House unobserved and in making her
way by the back passages to within a few yards of
the sacred chamber of debate itself. Here she was
captured by the police, but she resisted their efforts
to remove her with so much spirit that she won the
sympathy and admiration of the constables; one of
whom was heard to say, "I wish the members of
Parliament would come here and do their own dirty
work!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day as the evening-paper boys were eagerly
crying the news that another five women were gone
to join those already in prison and that twenty-one
Suffragettes would now be spending Christmas there,
Parliament rose for the holidays. As the Members
left the House, comrades of the imprisoned women
handed each one an envelope inscribed:&mdash;"What
a woman really wants for a Christmas box," and
within was a small slip of paper bearing the words,
"A vote."</p>

<p>For the first batch of Suffragettes to be released
from prison in January, a Christmas dinner was provided
by Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence at the
Holborn Restaurant, and for Mrs. Drummond and
those of the Suffragettes who were set free later, the
first of the public welcome breakfasts, which have
since become an institution, was held at Anderton's
Hotel. The released prisoners were able to tell us
that Christmas day in Holloway is, except that one
goes twice to Chapel, exactly like all the other days
of the year and that the Christmas dinner, of which
so very much is thought outside, is just the usual one
that would naturally fall at any other season to that
particular day of the week. But as Mrs. Hillier on
their release, said, they went to prison for "a cause
that they held dear," and so, as Mrs. Martha Jones
added, they regarded having gone there, "not as a
sacrifice, but as an honour." What they had seen in
Holloway had more than ever convinced them of the
pressing need that women should be enfranchised.
"The stories that I have heard in the Prison
hospital," said Mrs. Baines, "have reached to the
bottom of my heart. I have come out with the firm
resolve to work on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>So the year 1906, the first year of the Union's
work in London came to an end. In October, the
step of opening a permanent central office had been
decided upon and a large general office having a small
private room opening out of it was taken in Clement's
Inn, Strand. It seemed a big undertaking at first,
but the offices were indispensable. The small room
was considered chiefly as Christabel's office, but all
private business was transacted there, whilst the large
room was used for general clerical work and as a
meeting place. Weekly Monday afternoon and
Thursday evening At Homes, were held there and
all those who had joined the Union in those early
days can remember Mrs. Sparborough making tea
and handing round bread and butter and biscuits, and
Christabel, with a sheaf of newspaper cuttings in her
hand, standing up on one of the chairs to furnish
the latest news of the militant campaign and to explain
the next move in the plan of action.</p>

<p>On the following February 4th, Mr. Winston
Churchill spoke in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester,
and he bargained beforehand with the Suffragettes
that they should not interrupt him during his speech,
on condition that he would answer a question on
Women's Suffrage before he left the platform. At
the close of the meeting he accordingly did so by
saying definitely that he would not vote for a Bill to
enfranchise women on the same terms as men. He
added that he greatly regretted that "earnest, good-hearted
women should pursue courses which brought
them suffering and humiliation," but "God forbid"
that he should "mock" them by concealing his opinion.
My sister Adela then rose to ask if he had intended
to speak for himself alone, or on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Government, an exceedingly important point.
What followed is best described in the words of an
eye witness who wrote at once to Christabel at Clement's
Inn: "Last night's affair was terrible. It was
a wonder someone was not killed. Your sister was
thrown down and kicked by several men. The attack
was really unprovoked; the stewards had made
up their minds to do it before the meeting. Your
sister has a black eye, Mrs. Chatterton's throat was
hurt and Miss Gawthorpe would have been seriously
handled but that some men came to her rescue."</p>

<p>Many women who had long felt that there was
"something wrong" with the position of their sex,
but had not realised that the possession of the Parliamentary
franchise could do anything to remove the
disabilities both of law and custom from which they
suffered, were now being awakened by the much-talked-of
militant tactics to a knowledge of what the
vote could do for them. Moreover, many who for
years had been nominal adherents of the Suffrage
movement, now began to feel that if some other
women cared so passionately for the cause that they
were prepared to throw aside all the usual conventions
of good manners and to thrust themselves forward
to meet ridicule, scandalous abuse, ill usage and
imprisonment, it was surely time that they too should
make sacrifices. Their hearts smote them that they
had not done more for it in the past. But most of
them as yet thought only of bolstering up and stirring
to new activity the old National Union of Women's
Suffrage Societies for they still looked upon the militant
women as a rather dreadful body of fanatics
who could have no notion either of systematic organisation
or the prudent laying-out of money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Therefore, though the W. S. P. U. was already
growing largely, the N. U. W. S. S. was as yet benefiting
most largely from its activities. But times had
changed and even the most old-fashioned of the Suffragists
were now ready to copy the first non-militant
doings of the Suffragettes and, in order to prove that
they really wanted the franchise, they too determined
to march in procession through the London streets.
Therefore on February 9th, 1907, three days before
the opening of Parliament, a crowd of the non-militants
assembled close to the Achilles statue at
Hyde Park Corner. It was a dismal wet Saturday
afternoon, but in spite of the rain and the muddy
streets a procession of women half a mile in length
was formed and marched steadily on to attend meetings
in Exeter Hall in the Strand and in Trafalgar
Square. This procession was afterwards known as
the "Mud March."</p>

<p>At the Exeter Hall the principal speakers who had
been chosen to address the gathering of women were
Mr. Keir Hardie and Mr. Israel Zangwill. Mr.
Hardie devoted himself to urging the women to place
the question of their enfranchisement before all other
party considerations. Meanwhile a most extraordinary
scene occurred, for, whilst his remarks were
punctuated by volumes of cheers from the great body
of the audience, a number of Liberal ladies on the
platform set up a hissing chorus.</p>

<p>When Mr. Zangwill came to speak, he, too, declared
himself to be a supporter of the militant tactics
and the anti-Government policy, and the same
Liberal ladies, although they had themselves asked
him to speak for them, expressed their dissent and
disapproval as audibly as though they had been Suffragettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and he a Cabinet Minister. From Mr.
Zangwill's brilliant speech&mdash;his maiden speech as a
politician as he said it was&mdash;which has since been
published under the title "One and One are Two," I
can but quote an extract to conclude this chapter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>What is it that prevents the Prime Minister bringing in
a Bill for Female Suffrage at once, in this very Parliament
that is opening? He is in favour of it himself, and so is
the majority of the House. The bulk of the representatives
of the people are pledged to it. Here, then, is a
measure which both parties deem necessary. A sensible
woman would think that the first thing a Parliament would
do would be to pass those measures about which both parties
agree. Simple female! That is not man's way. That
is not politics. What is wanted in Parliament is measures
about which both parties <i>disagree</i>, and which, in consequence,
can never be passed at all. I declare I know nothing
outside Swift or W. S. Gilbert to equal the present
situation of Women's Suffrage.... The majority
have promised to vote for Women's Suffrage. But <i>whom</i>
have they promised? Women. And women have no votes.
Therefore the M.P.s do not take them seriously. You see
the vicious circle. In order for women to get votes they
must have votes already. And so the men will bemock
and befool them from session to session. Who can wonder
if, tired of these gay deceivers, they begin to take the law
into their own hands? And public opinion&mdash;I warn the
Government&mdash;public opinion is with the women....
They <i>are</i> unwomanly&mdash;and therein consists the martyrdom
of the pioneers. They have to lower themselves to the
manners of men; they have to be unwomanly in order to
promote the cause of womanhood. They have to do the
dirty work. Let those lady suffragists who sit by their
cosey firesides at least give them admiration and encouragement.
"Qui veut la fin, veut les moyens." And undoubtedly
the means are not the most ladylike. Ladylike means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
are all very well if you are dealing with gentlemen; but
you are dealing with politicians.... In politics only
force counts, but how is a discredited minority to exercise
force?... There is a little loophole. Every now
and then the party in power has to venture outside its citadel
to contest a by-election. The ladies are waiting. The
constituency becomes the arena of battle, and every Government
candidate, whether he is for female suffrage or not,
is opposed tooth and nail. For every Government&mdash;Liberal
or Conservative&mdash;that refuses to grant Female Suffrage
is ipso facto the enemy. The cause is to be greater
than mere party. Damage the Government&mdash;that is the
whole secret. Are these tactics sound? In my opinion,
absolutely so. They are not only ladylike, they are constitutional.
They are the only legitimate way in which
woman can bring direct political pressure upon the Government....
Far better than to put yourself in prison
is to keep a man out of Parliament.... What Christianity
cannot do, what charity cannot do, what all the
thunder of your Carlyles and your Ruskins cannot do, a
simple vote does. And so to these myriads of tired women
who rise in the raw dawn and troop to their cheerless factories,
and who, when the twilight falls, return not to rest
but to the labours of a squalid household, to these the
thought of Women's Suffrage, which comes as a sneer to
the man about town, comes as a hope and a prayer. Who
dares leave that hope unillumined, that prayer unanswered?...
For fifty years now woman has stood crying: "I
stand for justice&mdash;answer, shall I have it?" And the
answer has been a mocking "no" or a still more mocking
"yes." With this flabby friendliness, this policy of endless
evasion. To-day she cries: "I <i>fight</i> for justice and
I answer that I <i>shall</i> have it."</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>FEBRUARY AND MARCH, 1907</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The First Woman's Parliament in the Caxton
Hall and the Sending Out of the Mounted Police
to Drive Away the Women's Deputation.
Mr. Dickinson's Bill and the Second Women's
Parliament.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>And now again the thoughts of all the women
who wanted votes were turning towards the opening
of Parliament. The old fashioned Suffragists had
held their demonstration during the recess but that
of the Suffragettes was still to come and it had been
announced that on February 13th, 1907, a Parliament
of women would sit in the Caxton Hall to
consider the provision of the King's speech to be
read in the Nation's Parliament on the previous day.
It was but a year since Annie Kenney had set off to
rouse London and since Mrs. Pankhurst had feared
that we should neither fill the Caxton Hall nor induce
a body of women to march for the sake of a vote
through the London streets, but the tickets were now
sold off so rapidly that the Exeter Hall in the Strand
was also requisitioned, and we could now firmly rely
on hundreds of women who were ready and eager,
not merely to walk in procession, but if need be to
risk imprisonment for the Cause.</p>

<p>Parliament met on Tuesday the 12th, and we soon
learnt that the King's speech had made no mention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Votes for Women. Therefore when the Women's
Parliament met at three o'clock next day, it did so
ready for decisive action. Mrs. Pankhurst was in
the Chair, and throughout the proceedings there were
manifestations of an enthusiasm such as the women
of our time had before then never learnt to show.
A Resolution expressive of indignation that Votes for
Women had been omitted from the King's speech and
calling upon the House of Commons to insist that
precedence should be given to such a measure, was
moved in stirring words and carried with every demonstration
of fervent eagerness. A motion that the
resolution should be taken to the Prime Minister by a
deputation from the meeting was greeted with cheering
and waving of handkerchiefs. Then the watchword,
"Rise up women!" was sounded, and the answer
came in a great unanimous shout, "Now,"
while hundreds of women volunteers ready for Parliament
or Prison sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Despard was chosen to lead the deputation,
and, as each woman marched out of the Caxton Hall,
a copy of the Resolution for the Prime Minister was
put into her hand. We formed up in orderly procession,
and, amid the cheers of the thousands of men
and women who had gathered in sympathy, and with
police walking in front of us, we marched into Victoria
Street and on towards the House of Commons.</p>

<p>It was cold but a shimmering dainty day, the sky
a delicate rain-washed blue and the sunshine gleaming
on the fine gilded points on the roof of the tall
clock tower. We stepped out smartly and all seemed
to be going well, but when those who were in front
reached the green in front of the Abbey, a body of
police barred their way and an Inspector called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
them to turn back, and ordered his men to break up
the procession. The police strode through and
through our ranks, but the women at once united
again and pressed bravely on. A little further we
went thus, when suddenly, a body of mounted police
came riding up. In an instant Mrs. Despard and
several others in the front rank were arrested, and
the troopers were urging their horses into the midst
of the women behind, scattering them right and left.</p>

<p>Still we strove to reach our destination, and returned
again and again. Those of us who rushed
from the roadway on to the pavement were pressed
by the horses closer and closer against the walls and
railings until at last we retreated or were forced away
by the constables on foot. Those of us who took
refuge in doorways were dragged roughly down the
steps and hurled back in front of the horses. When
even this failed to banish us, the foot constables
rushed at us and, catching us fiercely by the shoulders,
turned us round again and then seizing us by the
back of the neck and thumping us cruelly between
the shoulders forced us at a running pace along the
streets until we were far from the House of Commons.
They had been told to drive us away and
to make as few arrests as possible. Still we returned
again, until at last sixty-five women and two
men, all of them bruised and dishevelled, had been
taken to the police station, and those who had not
been arrested were almost fainting from fatigue.
Then, after ten o'clock, the police succeeded in clearing
the approaches to the House of Commons, and
the mounted men were left galloping about in the
empty square till midnight, when the House rose.</p>

<p>In spite of the fierce battle to keep them out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fifteen of the Suffragettes succeeded by strategy in
making their way into the Strangers' Lobby of the
House of Commons and at about six o'clock attempted
to hold a meeting there. The police, of
course, rushed to put them out and, in the confusion
that ensued one of the women succeeded in getting
past the barriers and making her way down the
passage leading to the beautiful white inner lobby
which opens into the sacred chamber of debate. She
had just reached the first set of swing-doors when
a Member of Parliament dashed up and slammed
them against her with such force that she was thrown
to the ground and carried out in a fainting condition.</p>

<p>Members of Parliament could scarcely fail to have
been impressed by the extraordinary scenes which
had taken place, and when the adjournment of the
House was moved that night a Unionist Member,
Mr. Claud Hay, asked the Home Secretary whether
it had been necessary to inconvenience its Members
by surrounding Parliament with a body of police,
both upon horse and foot, as great as though it had
been a fortress instead of a deliberative assembly.
It appeared to him, he said, that Mr. Gladstone
was afraid of the women, but they were entitled
to make a protest even if it were not agreeable to
Members of Parliament, and there was no need to
brow-beat them by using force. Mr. Gladstone replied
that he had very little knowledge of what had
been going on outside the House, but Mr. Claud
Hay interrupted him with, "Then you ought to
have!" At that he hesitated and changed his tone,
saying that it was the police who were responsible
for keeping open the approaches to the House, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
they had only done their duty, and that he hoped
they would continue to do it in the same way.</p>

<p>Next morning all the world was talking of the
mêlée, and in the newspapers there were long accounts
and startling headlines describing the scenes
that had taken place. These were very much more
favourable to the women than any which had been
published hitherto, for, though the Press was still
far from admitting the extreme urgency of the cause
of Women's Suffrage, or the need for the militant
tactics as a means of obtaining the Parliamentary
vote, still a large section of both Press and public
were unanimous in condemning the Government for
the violent measures which it had employed to suppress
the women's deputation. Many compared the
sending out of mounted police against a procession
of unarmed women to the employment of Cossacks
in Russia, and the <i>Liberal Daily Chronicle</i> published
a cartoon called "The London Cossack"
which showed a portly policeman riding off with a
trophy of ladies' hats.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on Thursday morning, January
14th, the fifty-seven women and the two men who
had been arrested on the previous day appeared at
the Westminster Police Court. The women were
put in one of the side rooms, and then a band of
policemen filed in and each one identified his prisoner.
For most of the women this was a first visit
to the police court, and, though many of them were
severely bruised by the previous day's encounter,
they were all determined to make the best of the
experience and to dwell, as far as possible, upon the
humorous side of the situation. Whilst the Suffragettes
were ready to forgive, the constables seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
mostly anxious to forget the violence, and many of
the men asked their captives to give them the round
white "Votes for Women" buttons which they were
wearing as mementoes of the women's famous
"raid" on the House of Commons. After waiting
until the drunkards and pickpockets had been disposed
of, the Suffragettes were taken into the Court
one or two at a time. Christabel Pankhurst, as
organiser of the Demonstration was, at her own request,
the first to be placed in the dock. She explained
clearly that many of our members had suffered
very seriously, but that the W. S. P. U. wished
to fix the blame for what had occurred, not upon
the police, but upon the Government that had dictated
the use of these measures for clearing the
women away. If the Government refused to take
"the only just, simple and proper way out of the
difficulty&mdash;that of giving women their undoubted
right to vote," she said, "the responsibility must be
theirs, and if lives are lost in this campaign the
Liberal Government will be directly responsible.
One thing is certain; there can be no going back for
us, and more will happen if we do not get justice."
Mr. Curtis Bennett, the magistrate, here intervened,
saying with what he evidently thought was unanswerable
firmness, that the women undoubtedly were
responsible for all the trouble, that there were other
means of obtaining votes; and that these disorderly
scenes in the streets must be stopped. "They can
be stopped," she retorted, "but only in one way."
He looked at her sternly, and "twenty shillings or
fourteen days," was his sole reply. Then she was
hurried away, and, in an incredibly short space of
time, fifty-four Suffragettes had been tried and sentenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to undergo punishment varying from ten shillings
or seven days' imprisonment to forty shillings
or one month. Forty shillings or one month's
imprisonment had also been imposed on a working
man, Mr. Edward Croft, who had been arrested
for trying to defend one of the women in Parliament
Square. All those who had been convicted
refused to pay their fines and decided to go to prison,
and whilst Mr. Croft was removed to Pentonville,
we Suffragettes were taken away in the van to Holloway
Gaol.</p>

<p>On arriving at the prison we found that, as was
now the rule, most of our number were to be treated
as first class misdemeanants, though some few, without
any apparent reason were to be placed in the
second division. Those of us who had been there
some months before now found that several minor
innovations had been introduced since our last visit
to Holloway. When we had originally been put in
the first class, Mrs. Cobden Sanderson, who was a
vegetarian, was daily served with the usual prison
diet, and though she was obliged to leave the meat,
no extra vegetables were allowed her, and she was
obliged to exist on her potatoes and bread. Now a
special dietary had been introduced for vegetarians,
which consisted at this season of an alternation of
carrots and onions, with occasional rather stale eggs
as a substitute for meat, and milk, night and morning,
instead of cocoa and tea. Butter was sometimes
allowed by the doctor's special order. Now
that so large a number of us occupied adjoining cells
in one corridor and were sent out to exercise together
apart from the other prisoners, the authorities
found it difficult to enforce the full rigour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the prison régime. They found it difficult to prevent
our speaking to each other occasionally when
we stood together in line waiting to be marched to
exercise or chapel; they could scarcely stop the tapping
out conversations on the cell walls which was
carried on by neighbouring Suffragettes. Sometimes,
when the wardresses were off duty, one of our number
would strike up a hymn or march to which words
suitable to our movement had been adapted. The
others would join in chorus; and when the officers
came hurrying back it would be some moments before
silence could be restored.</p>

<p>For one cause or another many of us were sent
to the hospital, some being placed in a ward with
some twenty or thirty other prisoners, others in
separate hospital cells.</p>

<p>With the exception of Mrs. Despard and myself
all the Suffragettes were released at the end of the
first fortnight, but our sentences did not expire until a
week later. A procession had been organised to welcome
our comrades, and a band had played for an
hour outside the prison gates. It is difficult to describe
the effect upon ourselves which was created
by the music. We knew that it was being played
by our friends. We felt almost as though they
were speaking to us, and to hospital prisoners who
are not even allowed to attend service in the chapel,
the very sound of the music in that dreary place was
extraordinarily impressive. It made one's pulses
throb and filled one's eyes with tears.</p>

<p>The poor ordinary prisoners were filled with excitement
and delight and when we were out at exercise
with them on the day before our release, woman after
woman contrived to walk for a few moments either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
before or after one or other of us in the line and
to ask if we also would be met by a band. "How
splendid for you!" said one of the girls to me wistfully.
"I only wish I had friends to meet me.
But I am glad for you." "We are looking forward
to the band, but we shall be sorry to lose you," another
said.</p>

<p>Whilst so many of us had been in prison, a by-election
had taken place in South Aberdeen, where
Mrs. Pankhurst, at the head of the Suffragettes'
forces, had vigorously opposed the Government candidate
whose majority had fallen by more than 4,000
votes.</p>

<p>The figures were:&mdash;</p>

    <td class="tdr tdb">8,448</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Suffragists, too, had not been inactive, for
Mrs. Henry Fawcett, and four of her colleagues,
had written to the Prime Minister asking that they
might be allowed to plead the cause of Woman's Suffrage
at the Bar of the House. They pointed out
that in 1688, Anne, the widow of Edward Fitz
Harris, who was executed for treason in 1681, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
been allowed to speak for herself and her children
at the Bar, and that Mrs. Clarke, mistress of the
Duke of York, had been summoned thither to give
evidence in regard to the charges of corruption
against the Duke. Nevertheless, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
refused to grant their request on
the ground that there was no precedent for women
to appear at the Bar of the House in support of a
petition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, since the so-called "Raid" on the
House that had led to our imprisonment, candid
friends had been constantly telling us that we had
entirely alienated the sympathy of those who had
hitherto supported the enfranchisement of women.
Yet, even whilst the "Raid" had been in progress,
a very much larger number of Parliamentary representatives
were agreeing to give their places in the
private Members' ballot to a Woman's Suffrage Bill
than had ever done so before. When the result of
the ballot became known, it was found, that for the
first time in the history of the movement, the fortunate
member who had secured the coveted first
place out of 670 was willing to devote it to introducing
a measure to give votes to women. It was a
Liberal member, Mr. Dickinson, who had won the
first place and had decided to introduce the Women's
Enfranchisement Bill. The anti-Suffragists at once
began to work actively against the measure and the
first Women's Anti-Suffrage Society that had ever
been formed was inaugurated to oppose it. Two
petitions against the Women's Enfranchisement Bill,
one of them said to be signed by 21,000 and the
other by 16,500 persons, were presented to Parliament
on March 5th and March 22nd. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
heralded by the jubilations of our opponents but
when the petitions came to be examined they were
rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament
as "informal." This was because the separate sheets
upon which the signatures had been written were not
each headed by the prayer against the granting of
Women's Suffrage, and there was consequently no
evidence to prove that the signatories had known for
what purpose their names were being collected.
Afterwards Mr. J. M. Robertson examined the
Anti-Suffrage Petitions and reported that "whole
batches of signatures had been written in by a single
hand," that "the batch work began on the very first
sheets," and that it appeared as though the petitions
"had been got up wholesale in this fashion." Mr.
J. H. Wilson, M.P., Chairman of the Parliamentary
Committee on Public Petitions, afterwards stated in
the House of Commons, that the names of whole
families of persons had undoubtedly been written in
by the same hand. But even had these petitions
been so evidently authentic as to have been accepted
by Parliament without question, they would still
have been quite insignificant as compared with the
great petitions and memorials in support of Votes
for Women, which had been presented year after
year since 1866. But the days in which women
might have won or lost the Parliamentary vote by
petitioning had long gone by, and all politically
minded women knew this.</p>

<p>For a Member of Parliament to declare himself
in open opposition to Votes for Women, rendered
him extremely unpopular, many of the anti-Suffragists,
especially of the Liberal Party, now
pretended that their reason for objecting to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Dickinson's Bill was that they did not consider it to
be a democratic measure. They declared that it
would "disfranchise married women" would give
the vote to women of wealth and property only and
would exclude all those who had to work for their
own living. So emphatically was this statement
made that it was difficult to convince many people
that the measure in question was the old equal
Women's Enfranchisement Bill, and that there was
no intention of introducing some new-fangled, fancy
franchise. Yet as a matter of fact, Mr. Dickinson's
Bill contained only a slight alteration in the wording,
though not in the sense, of the last clause of the
original measure. Instead of the phrase "any law
or usage to the contrary notwithstanding," which
occurred in the original Bill and was intended to
strike at the disability of coverture which affects
married women, the words, "A woman shall not
be disqualified by reason of marriage from being so
registered and voting, notwithstanding any law or
custom to the contrary," were substituted.</p>

<p>On moving the Second Reading of the Bill, Mr.
Dickinson dealt especially with the objections of
those who declared that the measure was anti-democratic.
He stated, that in 1904, the women electors
in his constituency of North St. Pancras had numbered
1,014. Of these women three per cent. had
belonged to the wealthy upper class, thirty-seven per
cent. to the middle class, and sixty per cent. to the
working class; many of the latter being exceedingly
poor.</p>

<p>When asked by the Secretary of the Local
Women's Suffrage Society in his constituency of
Dunfermline, whether he would support the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
reading of the Bill, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
had replied, "I will with much pleasure give my support
to Mr. Dickinson's Bill when it comes before the
House of Commons." Now that the moment for
fulfilling his promise had arrived, however, the Prime
Minister threw cold water upon the measure. "I
am not very warmly enamoured of it," he said, and
after casting doubt upon the accuracy of Mr. Dickinson's
figures he added, that in his opinion, the
Bill would merely "enfranchise a small minority of
well-to-do women." Where the Prime Minister had
led, the rank and file Anti-Suffragist Liberal Members
of Parliament followed. Though they had
neither facts nor figures of their own to quote in support
of their contention, and, in face of both of
Mr. Dickinson's figures and Mr. Snowden's reminder
that the I. L. P. census of 1904 had shown that
eighty-two per cent. of the women on the Municipal
Register belonged to the working classes, they still
continued to assert that only "a handful of propertied
women" could obtain votes under this Bill.
At the same time, although they themselves belonged
almost exclusively to the middle and upper classes,
they persistently stated their belief in the dangerous
influence of the women who belonged to those same
classes.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on attempts were made to
move the closure of the debate in order that a vote
on the Bill might be taken, but the Speaker refused
to accept the resolution, and at five o'clock Mr. Rees,
the Liberal Member for Montgomery Burghs talked
the measure out after a five hours' debate. There
was no protest from the Ladies' Gallery this time
as the Suffragettes had all been rigorously excluded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
but both Suffragettes and Suffragists combined in
urging the Government to give another day for the
discussion of the Bill. This they curtly refused, and
though the Suffragettes had not agreed to accept
the decision as final and intended to renew their
demand until it was granted, Mr. Dickinson shortly
afterwards withdrew his Bill in order to make way
for a Women's Suffrage Resolution, a place for
which had been obtained by Sir Charles M'Laren.
No sooner had Mr. Dickinson's Bill been withdrawn
and Sir Charles M'Laren's Resolution set down in
its stead than it was blocked by a discreditable move
on the part of a well known anti-Suffragist, Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Maurice Levy. Taking advantage
of a rule of the House of Commons by which
a Resolution cannot be proceeded with, if a Bill
dealing with a similar subject has been introduced,
this Liberal member now brought forward a Bill
which he never intended to be discussed to give a
vote to every adult man and woman. Therefore
Sir Charles M'Laren's Resolution was thus entirely
shelved. This was not by any means the first time
that the trick had been used in the case of a Women's
Suffrage motion, but the device was acknowledged to
be an unjustifiable abuse of the Procedure rules.
Mr. Levy refused even the Speaker's request to
withdraw his dummy Bill. Protests were raised on
all sides of the House, because it was realised that,
if the practice of bringing in dummy Bills to prevent
discussion were to become common, the right of
private Members to introduce Resolutions would be
entirely destroyed. A Resolution embodying this
point of view was therefore agreed to, and Mr.
Asquith promised that the Government would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
action in the matter.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Though the question was
raised again three months later, however, the promise
was never kept, and though the general feeling
was that Mr. Levy had offended against the recognised
etiquette of Parliament, it must be remembered,
that, as the <i>Standard</i> put it "if the Government
had chosen to exercise pressure Mr. Levy
would have proved complaisant."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>But after all this was only a Resolution, and, realising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that the Government, with practically all the time
of Parliament at its disposal, could easily provide
the few days necessary for carrying into Law a
Woman's Suffrage measure, the Women's Social and
Political Union were now preparing for further militant
action.</p>

<p>On the day of the talking out of Mr. Dickinson's
Bill a meeting had been held by the Union
in the Exeter Hall at which Mrs. Pethick Lawrence
had called for subscriptions to inaugurate a
£20,000 campaign fund, and over £1,400 had been
sent up to the platform during the meeting. On
March 20th, 1907, the second Women's Parliament
assembled in the Caxton Hall.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This Parliament
was specially characterised by the large numbers of
delegates from the provinces, amongst whom was a
contingent of Lancashire Cotton Operatives, led by
Annie Kenney and wearing their clogs and shawls.
As before, the decision to carry a resolution to the
Prime Minister was heralded with an enthusiasm
that was almost fiercely overwhelming. Then, when
Christabel Pankhurst called out from the platform,
"Who will lead the deputation?" Lady Harberton,
for many years a Suffragist of the old school,
eagerly answered "I," and at once hundreds of
women sprang up to follow her. As soon as the
deputation gained the street the police began to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and hustle them, but though overwhelmingly outnumbered,
they bravely strove hour after hour to
carry out their purpose. Rigid lines of police drawn
up across the approaches to the House prevented
their even getting near to it, and though at one point
a number of Lancashire mill hands drove up in a
couple of waggonettes, and, being mistaken for sightseers,
succeeded in reaching the Strangers' Entrance,
they were discovered and beaten back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Caxton Hall was kept open all the
afternoon and on into the evening, and the disabled
women were constantly returning thither. They
brought with them the news that numbers of women
had been arrested, and that though Lady Harberton
had at last got into the House of Commons, her
petition had been ignored. Christabel Pankhurst
then advised any who might succeed in entering
Parliament to take sterner measures,&mdash;to rush, if
they could, into the sacred Chamber of debate itself,
to seat themselves upon the Government bench
and demand a hearing. "If possible," she cried,
"seize the mace, and you will be the Cromwells of
the twentieth century!" The women rushed back
with renewed zeal.</p>

<p>It was now dark, and, as the crowds grew denser
and denser and the police turned on them more
angrily, many Members of Parliament, including
Mr. Herbert Gladstone and Mr. Lloyd George,
came out to watch the scene. Some showed distress
at the way in which the women were being treated,
but others regarded it as a joke. Many of the
women were roughly handled and some were seriously
hurt, but, speaking generally, the violence used
against them was not so great as on the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
February 13th. It was said that no fewer than a
thousand extra police were especially drafted into
Parliament Square to guard the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Amongst those who had been arrested were Dr.
Mabel Hardy, Miss Naici Peters, a Norwegian
painter and a friend of Ibsen, Miss Cemino Folliero,
a portrait painter from Rome and Miss Constance
Clyde, a well known Australian journalist and
novelist.</p>

<p>Next day when the women were brought up before
Mr. Horace Smith at the Westminster Police
Court, Mr. Muskett, who appeared to prosecute on
behalf of the police, protested that the Suffragettes
had hitherto been treated with "the utmost indulgence,"
and begged that they should in future be dealt
with "as ordinary law-breakers." Therefore the
magistrate gave to most of the women exactly the
same sentences&mdash;varying from twenty shillings or
fourteen days to forty shillings or one month's imprisonment&mdash;that
had been meted out to their comrades
on the last occasion. Miss Patricia Woodlock and
Mrs. Ada Chatterton, the former having only left
Holloway on the expiration of her previous month's
imprisonment one week before, were, as "old offenders,"
sentenced to one month's imprisonment without
the option of a fine. Mrs. Mary Leigh though this
was her first arrest, also received a month's imprisonment
because, by hanging a Votes for Women banner
over the edge of the dock, she annoyed the magistrate,
who said that he did not think it "a decent
thing to wave a flag in a court of justice."</p>

<p>Thus as a result of two attempts within the short
space of five weeks to carry Resolutions to the Prime
Minister from meetings of women held in the Caxton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Hall, one hundred and thirty women, who were
agitating for an eminently just and absolutely
simple reform, had been imprisoned. Even to the
next generation this state of things will appear monstrous,
how much more so to those that are to follow
in the dim future.</p>

dealing with the Veto of the House of Lords, three months
afterwards, Lord Robert Cecil, introduced a Dummy Bill for the
abolition of the House of Lords' Veto in order to prevent Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman's motion being discussed, and thus
to teach the anti-Suffragists that their own blocking tactics could
be used against themselves. As Lord Robert Cecil came forward
with his Bill, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, knowing
what he was going to do, begged him not to introduce it,
in order that the Government's Resolution might not be delayed.
If Lord Robert Cecil would not agree, the Prime Minister
threatened to call a sitting of the House for the next
Saturday&mdash;the day which had been fixed for the King's garden
party&mdash;in order to pass a special motion to allow the Government's
Resolution to be proceeded with. Still Lord Robert
Cecil protested that the Government must draw up the proposed
Standing Order or he would insist upon introducing his
Bill and Mr. Balfour supported him saying, "You can cook
up a land Bill in three days, yet you cannot draft a Standing
Order in three months." In the end the Government again
promised to make such action as Mr. Levy's impossible, and
Lord Robert Cecil withdrew his Bill, but the promise has not
yet been redeemed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>A CROP OF BY-ELECTIONS, MARCH TO
MAY, 1907</small></h2>


<p>No sooner had the second Women's Parliament
been concluded than Mrs. Pankhurst had hurried
off by the night train to take command of the Suffragette
forces against the Government at a by-election
at Hexham in Northumberland, where the
Liberal majority was reduced by more than a thousand
votes. This election was scarcely over when
it was followed, with scarcely a week's intermission,
by no fewer than seven others, at six of which the
Suffragettes were to the fore.</p>

<p>From Hexham our militant army was transferred
to Stepney and then to Rutland, the smallest English
County.</p>

<p>Writing at the beginning of the Rutland contest,
the <i>Daily News</i> correspondent said: "Each of the
three parties (the third being the Women's Social
and Political Union) opened its campaign with meetings
in the Rutland Division to-night." Thus recognised
from the start as one of the three forces to
be reckoned with in the Election, the W. S. P. U.
kept its important position right through until the
end. In every hamlet and village the women speakers
were cordially received and their speeches were
listened to with earnest attention and respect. After
the meetings, men and women clustered round to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
questions and tell how, before the passing of the
1884 Reform Act which had enfranchised the agricultural
labourers, in the days when voters were
scarce, widows and daughters whose fathers were
dead, had been frequently turned out of their farms,
not because they could not pay the rent, but because
they could not vote. Even to-day the people said
that a woman tenant was sometimes looked upon
with disfavour on that account. Though the wages
of the agricultural labourers in this district were exceedingly
low, there was hardly a single member
of the audience who did not buy at least one badge
or penny pamphlet, whilst the free leaflets were
eagerly seized upon, and labourers would come hurrying
across the fields to the roadside in order to secure
them.</p>

<p>As the days went by the journeyings of the Suffragettes
from meeting place to meeting place
throughout the constituency became a sort of triumphal
progress. We were cheerily hailed from
afar by distant workers amongst the crops and by
drivers of passing carts. Men, women and children
ran to the cottage doors to see us pass, and everywhere
we were greeted with smiles and kindly words.</p>

<p>Only in the towns, at Oakham, the capital, and
at Uppingham, did we meet with any opposition, but
here most of the working men were deeply anxious
that the Liberal should be returned. Rightly or
wrongly they believed in the Liberal Party, believed
it to be the party of progress and the one that would
stand by the poor man. Nevertheless the majority
listened courteously to our arguments, and admitting
at last that our policy was logical and right for
us, although inconvenient to them. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
staunchest Liberals were even won over to go all
the way with us and to help us to "keep the Liberal
out."</p>

<p>But, whilst the majority were thus willing to listen
and anxious to understand, there was also a bitterly
hostile element which was inflamed by an absolutely
unreasoning spirit of party antagonism, and it was
well known, and quite openly stated in Oakham, that
a certain well-to-do Liberal was paying a gang of
youths to shout down the Suffragettes at their nightly
meetings in the market place. It is always found by
those who take part in political warfare that the
roughest and least civilised members of society are
invariably opposed to the pioneer and the reformer
and usually support the Government in power, to
whatever party it may belong, just as they try to
"back the winner" in a race. With the additional
monetary incentive to create a disturbance, this element
soon rendered our market place meetings unpleasantly
turbulent, with the result that the local
police were kept busier than they had been for a
generation, and reinforcements had to be sent in
from Leicestershire in order to keep the peace.
The tradesman from whom we hired the lorry
that we used as a platform, now announced that he
dared not let us have it in future because he had
been warned, not only that the vehicle itself would
be damaged, but that his windows would be broken
and his shop looted. Not until we had tried without
success every lorry owner in Oakham, did a man,
who was storing a waggon for a farmer living many
miles outside the constituency, at last come to us and
say that, if we would go to the barn in the field
where it was kept and fetch it out for ourselves, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
might have the use of this waggon on promising to
make good any damage that might be done. We
agreed to this and were able to hold our meetings
right on until the end of the contest, though on the
last two nights very little that we said could be
heard, owing to the number of horns, bells and rattles
that were loudly sounded by our opponents.
After these stormy meetings the police and hosts of
sympathisers always escorted us home to protect us
from the rowdies. Just as we reached our door
there was generally a little scuffle with a band of
youths who waited there to pelt us with sand and
gravel as we passed in. Once inside the house, the
rest of the evening was always taken up with interviewing
the host of previously unknown callers, who
came to ask whether we had arrived home safely,
to apologise for the roughs, to express sympathy
with "Votes for Women," to buy literature, badges
and buttons, or to ask us to inscribe our names in
autograph albums. At Uppingham, the second
largest town, the hostile element was smaller than
at Oakham, but its methods were more dangerous.
Whilst Mary Gawthorpe was holding an open-air
meeting there one evening, a crowd of noisy youths
began to throw up peppermint "bull's eyes" and
other hard-boiled sweets. "Sweets to the sweet,"
said little Mary, smiling, and continued her argument,
but a pot-egg, thrown from the crowd behind,
struck her on the head and she fell unconscious. She
was carried away, but next day appeared again,
like a true Suffragette, quite undaunted, and the incident
and her plucky spirit, made her the heroine
of the Election. Polling took place on June 11th,
and instead of the great increase in the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
vote that had been expected the Conservative majority
was nearly doubled. The figures were:</p>

<p>The campaign in Rutland was not yet over, when
Mrs. Pankhurst and part of our forces were obliged
to go north to Jarrow, where there was a Government
majority of nearly three thousand votes to pull
down. The Conservatives, the Labour Party, the
Irish Nationalists, and, of course, the Liberals themselves
had each put a candidate into the field, and
every one of this bevy of candidates was "in favour"
of Votes for Women.</p>

<p>Whether the majority of these who came in contact
with the Suffragettes during these By-Election
Campaigns understood the workings of the Party machinery,
which controls the Government of our country,
well enough to realise that by voting against the
Government they would help the Votes for Women
cause may perhaps be doubted by some, though the
Suffragettes were constantly receiving both written
and verbal assurances from electors who declared
that their votes had turned upon this question; but
that the hearts of the people were stirred by the Suffragettes'
appeal is absolutely sure. In the leafy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
lanes and tiny villages of Rutland great interest and
sympathy had been evoked, but in smoky struggling
Jarrow, with its coal mines, shipbuilding yards and
engineering works, with its dingy slums where overcrowding
and infant mortality are, in common with
the rest of this district, more rife than in any other
part of the country, the message of the Suffragettes
came to the overburdened women as a wonderful ray
of hope that had burst in upon the squalor of their
lives.</p>

<p>On the first night of their arrival in Jarrow, Mrs.
Pankhurst and Annie Kenney held the largest open-air
meeting that had ever been seen in that town,
and the numberless subsequent gatherings, whether
for men and women, or for women only, which were
held in halls, in open spaces, at work gates, and at
the collieries, were, in every case, larger and more
orderly than those held by any of the other parties.
A systematic canvass was made of the women householders,
who numbered more than one thousand, and
a Committee of Local Women who had come forward
with offers of help sprang almost spontaneously
into being.</p>

<p>Three days before the end of the contest it was
suggested that a women's procession should march to
the various polling booths, in order to remind the
men to vote against the nominee of the Government
that had refused to allow women to become voters
too. The idea was eagerly caught up, banners were
quickly made by voluntary helpers, the news was carried
throughout the district, and on polling day great
crowds of women came flocking to the Mechanics'
Hall, where they were to assemble. They came
early, but found that a well dressed mob of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and youths, wearing the Liberal Colours, had already
gathered to bar the doorway, and the women
were literally obliged to fight their way both in and
out of their own meeting. As soon as the procession
had got fairly out into the main road, however,
everything went well, for though at no time did the
police put in an appearance, either to keep order or
to clear the way for them, the women were protected
from obstruction by the sympathy and good will of
the populace. As they passed onward, greater and
greater numbers joined their ranks until it seemed
as though all the women of Jarrow were marching
along the road.</p>

<p>The men whom they met coming from the polling
booths greeted them with cheers and cries of "We
have voted for the women this time. We have
kept the Liberal out." They spoke truly, for when
the votes were counted, it was found that the Government
candidate was third on the list, and that
the Liberal vote at the General Election had been
reduced by more than half. The figures were:</p>

<p>Before the Jarrow election was over came another
in the Colne Valley, in Yorkshire, and here again an
old Liberal stronghold was wrested from the Government.
After the declaration of the poll, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Grayson, the successful candidate, publicly admitted
that his return was largely due to the heavily damaging
effect of the Suffragettes' attack upon his Liberal
opponent. An article<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> on this election headed
"Votes for Women, but Fair Play for Liberals,"
which appeared in the Liberal <i>Tribune</i>, condemning
the anti-Government by-election policy of the Suffragettes,
was an admission of the great influence
which they had been able to exercise at this and other
recent by-elections.</p>

<p>A more gracious tribute to the electioneering capabilities
of the Suffragettes by the special correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the <i>Morning Post</i> appeared in that paper on
August 1st, 1909, during the North West Staffordshire
by-election.</p>

<p>The next Election was at Bury St. Edmunds in
Suffolk. Here the Liberal vote was greatly reduced,
and that of the Conservative more than doubled.
The figures were:</p>

<p class="no-indent">When, after the declaration of the poll, the successful
candidate, the Hon. W. Guinness, appeared at
the window of the Angel Hotel to thank his supporters
and to speak to the people in the customary
way, he asked, "What has been the cause of this
great and glorious victory?" He was interrupted
by cries of "Votes for Women!" and by "Three
cheers for the Suffragettes!" vigorously given from
the assembled crowd. "No doubt the ladies had
something to do with it," he was constrained to agree.</p>

<p>During this first year of by-election work since
the anti-Government campaign had been started at
Eye and Cockermouth in 1906, the Suffragette forces
had grown very largely, and instead of the one or
two workers who had gone to the first contests there
were now upwards of thirty regular by-election campaigners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
who could always be relied upon, at headquarters.
During each contest from sixteen to
twenty meetings were held by the union each day.
At all these gatherings collections were taken and
admission was charged for many of the election
meetings held in halls, though both practices were
unexampled at Election times. A fine answer to the
Liberal cry that they were fighting with "Tory
Gold," and a striking proof of the Suffragette speakers'
popularity with the audiences were thus provided.
At every contest in which the Suffragettes had fought
hitherto, there had been a fall in the Government
vote, which had been reduced at Cockermouth by
1,446; at Huddersfield by 540; in North West
Derbyshire by 1,021; in South Aberdeen by 3,001;
at Hexham by 231; at Stepney by 503; at Rutland
by 202; at Jarrow by 4,573; at Colne Valley by
2,204; in North West Staffordshire by 271, and at
Bury St. Edmunds by 306; making in all a total loss
of votes to the Government of 13,300. In spite of
the denials of Party wire-pullers a part of this loss
was certainly due to the Suffragettes.</p>

<p>At some of the later election contests, beginning
at Hexham, a new complication had been introduced.
During all the years of its existence the old non-militant
National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies
had held entirely aloof from all election warfare but,
seeing that the Suffragettes during the first year of
their anti-Government by-election campaigning had
rapidly grown not only in surface popularity but in
real influence with the electorate, the older Suffragists
now came to the conclusion that they, too, must
adopt a by-election policy. Unfortunately, however,
the older Suffragists had not the courage to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
common cause with the Suffragettes who had raised
the question of Women's Suffrage from the position
of a stale, old-fashioned joke to that of a living,
moving force in practical politics. They decided, instead,
not to oppose the Government, but to support
any Parliamentary candidate who should declare himself
to be favourable to Woman Suffrage. If, as
generally happened nowadays, all the candidates
should claim to be favourable, the N. U. S. S. should
either support the most favourable, or remain neutral.
In the event of no candidate being favourable,
a special Women's Suffrage candidate might be run.</p>

<p>Thus, rather than boldly oppose a Government
that had only too clearly shown that it would never
give women the vote until it was forced to do so,
these old-fashioned Suffragists preferred to ignore
entirely the dominating principle of the politics of
their own time, namely, government by party. They
preferred to go on working for the return of a few
more of the Private Members of Parliament who,
though they already formed a majority of more than
two-thirds of the House of Commons, had themselves,
for the hundredth time, been proved to be incapable
of doing anything to prevent the wrecking of a
Women's Suffrage Bill, when, in that very March in
which this futile election policy was decided upon,
Mr. Dickinson's Bill had been "talked out."</p>

<p>It is always more difficult to carry out a weak policy
than a strong one, and the adoption of this particular
policy not only failed to advance the Suffrage
cause, but also failed in one object for which it
primarily was designed, namely, to prevent dissension
in the ranks of the National Union of Women's
Suffrage Societies itself. Many members at once seceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and joined the Women's Social and Political
Union, and many of those who did not actually resign
their membership of the old society now threw
all their energy into working for the younger, more
active and courageous body. On the other hand,
there were still those Liberal women who cared more
for party than for principle to be reckoned with,
and one of these, Lady Carlisle, resigned the Vice
Presidentship of the N. U. W. S. S., which she had
accepted but a few days before the new by-election
policy had been announced, because, in her party-ridden
opinion, to oppose a Liberal candidate who
was opposed to their enfranchisement, seemed too
"drastic" and "extreme" a course for women to
adopt.</p>

<p>When the by-election policy of the N. U. W. S. S.
came to be put into practice its unworkable character
was immediately demonstrated. The candidates
at Hexham were interviewed, with the result that the
Unionist, Colonel Bates, returned what was considered
to be a favourable answer, whilst the reply of
Mr. R. D. Holt, the Liberal, was said to be unsatisfactory.
The National Union of Women's Suffrage
Societies was therefore, according to the newly
framed policy, obliged to support the Conservative
candidate, but, when they proceeded to do so, many
of the Liberal members of the organisation objected,
and some even went so far as to work for the Liberal
candidate in opposition to their Secretary, Miss
Edith Palliser, and the rest of the Society. To
make matters even more embarrassing for those who
were endeavouring to carry out the policy the Liberal
candidate now veered round a point or two&mdash;as
candidates so often will&mdash;and stated that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
always been in favour of women's enfranchisement
and that his only fear was that women were not
asking for their votes upon a sufficiently democratic
basis. He was therefore proclaimed by his supporters
to be a staunch and devoted friend of the
Women's Suffrage Cause.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Suffragettes foresaw very clearly
that this new policy which would sometimes cause
the Suffragists to support the Government candidate
whom they themselves were strenuously working
against would confuse the electors and increase the
difficulty of explaining the anti-Government policy,
and, though the anti-Government policy was a very
simple one, even simple things are difficult to explain
when hosts of people are striving to misrepresent
them.</p>

<p>In May, the National Union of Suffrage Societies
decided to run a Parliamentary candidate of
their own, at a by-election in Wimbledon, and had
chosen as their nominee a well known Liberal, the
Hon. Bertrand Russell. The crushing defeat which
resulted has unfortunately been quoted as a proof
that the majority of the Parliamentary voters in that
constituency were opposed to the principle of
women's enfranchisement, but an impartial examination
into the facts shows clearly that they do not in
any way justify this conclusion.</p>

<p>The Wimbledon seat had always been held by the
Conservatives, and their majority at the General
Election, in spite of the then great Liberal revival,
had numbered more than 2,000 votes. Now, with
the well known and typical old Conservative, Mr.
Henry Chaplin, in the field, the Liberal Party considered
it wisest not to fight. Therefore, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for the intervention of the National Union of
Suffrage Societies, who opposed him because of
his anti-Suffragist views, Mr. Chaplin would have
been returned without a contest. Opinions may reasonably
be divided as to whether the game of running
Parliamentary candidates would possibly be
worth the candle to a Women's Suffrage Society, but
everyone will surely agree that if Suffrage candidates
were to be run at all, the chief object of the Suffragists
ought to have been to efface as far as possible
all other points of political difference between the
rival candidates in order that upon the question of
Votes for Women, and upon that question alone, the
electors might have decided how to vote. To ensure
that the single issue should predominate, it
might have been well to choose as the Suffragist
nominee a candidate whose views upon general
political questions were, either similar to those of his
anti-Suffrage opponent, or altogether colourless and
obscure. In any case it was essential that the Suffragist
candidate should be willing to subordinate all
his other political opinions and to concentrate his
attention absolutely upon the question of Votes for
Women. In this Election, however, though it was
well known that Liberalism was unpopular, the Suffragists
chose to represent them a strong Liberal
who was determined to make the election contest an
opportunity for propagating his Liberal principles.
That Mr. Bertrand Russell cared very much more
for Liberalism than he did for Women's Votes was
at once apparent. With the news that he had consented
to stand as the Suffrage candidate came the
announcement that he would not in any circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have agreed to do so had an official Liberal
been nominated, and he showed clearly that he had
no intention of standing out against the wishes of
his party leaders in order to press forward the
Women's Cause. Right from the outset the record
of the Liberal Government, and the general principles
of Liberalism were the points constantly put
before the electors, and it was upon these points that
the Election was really fought. Mr. Russell's Election
Address, which was in fact the manifesto of
the Suffragists, advocated Free Trade, the Taxation
of Land Values and other questions quite unconnected
with their cause. In his last message to the
electors he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I ask for the Liberal vote because I am a Liberal through
and through. I am just as much a Liberal as dozens of the
Ministerialists in the House of Commons, who are as keen
as ever I can be upon the Women's Suffrage question. To
those who waver about giving me their vote because they
have doubts on the women's question, I would ask, "Do you
prefer Mr. Chaplin, the protectionist and crusted Tory, to
one who is at least a Free Trader and Progressive?" Such
persons should remember that every vote not given to me is
given to my opponent!</p>
</div>

<p>The Conservatives eagerly seized the opportunity
of fighting Mr. Russell on the ground of his Liberalism
and scouted the idea of his being considered a
Women's Suffrage candidate. At the same time the
Liberals dissociated themselves from his candidature.
It was no great matter for surprise, therefore, that
Mr. Russell was defeated by more than 6,000 votes.
The figures were:</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is interesting to note that in the six elections which
had taken place since 1885 the Liberals had only
thought it worth their while to contest the seat on
three occasions, and on one of these the Liberal vote
had fallen below that recorded for Mr. Bertrand
Russell.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate feature of the contest
was that those of the Suffragist women who
genuinely wished to further the interests of the
women's cause without respect to party, instead of
taking command of the situation, leading their candidate
aright, and showing that they were determined
that Woman Suffrage should be the only
feature of the election, allowed the contest to be
dominated by Mr. Russell and his Liberal opinions.
Herein lay the great point of difference between the
Suffragists and the Suffragettes. The Suffragists
were ever prone to look upon their cause as a side
issue and to apologise for any impatient attempt to
press it to the front. The Suffragettes, on the other
hand, were ready to stake their all upon it and constantly
proclaimed it to be the highest and greatest
in the world.</p>

Suffragettes are the politicians of the Election.... I confess
that until I had seen the Suffragette Ironsides at work I
thought the Tariff Reform Ruperts unsurpassed. The organization
of the Suffragettes is as good as their political insight.
They adopt the "fan" formation. They usually have three or
four local centres in a scattered constituency. The members of
each group in each centre live together irrespective of class
differences. It is a pleasure to see the fan opened, controlled
and set by the controlling hand at the centre. Early in the
morning while men are sleeping or at the Committee Rooms a
group of women will walk up the street of their centre....
At the crossroads of each centre each single group becomes a
fan itself. Each member takes a different road. Chalk in
hand, each woman whilst, going to one meeting, makes the announcement
of another. The men usually hunt in couples.
They do not care to face these hostile audiences single-handed,
but each of these women, as often as not, tackles an audience
alone. If combined hammering is necessary the central hand
sends to the rescue. Their staying power, judging them by
the standard of men, is extraordinary. By taking afternoon as
well as evening meetings they have worked twice as hard as the
men. They are up earlier, they retire just as late. Women
against men, they are better speakers, more logical, better informed,
better phrased, with a surer insight for the telling
argument.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE FORMATION OF THE WOMEN'S
FREEDOM LEAGUE. REVIVAL OF
MILITANT TACTICS</small></h2>


<p>In spite of its unprecedented growth the Women's
Social and Political Union was now approaching a
very difficult crisis in its history; little by little, differences
of opinion in regard to questions of organisation
and policy had begun to show themselves
amongst the members of its governing body and
finally, in September, 1907, a reconstruction of the
Committee and Constitution of the Union took place.
Now, although every one of the original founders
of the Union remained, a number of those who had
for some time belonged to the Central Committee
left to form a new militant society called the
Women's Freedom League which opened offices at
18 Buckingham Street, Strand,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and of which Mrs.
Despard became Honorary Treasurer, Mrs. Billington
Grieg, Honorary Organiser, and Mrs. Edith
How Martyn, Honorary Secretary. At the same
time a reconstruction of the organising basis of the
Women's Social and Political Union itself was effected,
and it became obligatory for all members of
the Union to sign the following pledge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I endorse the objects and methods of the Women's Social
and Political Union and hereby undertake not to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the candidate of any political party at Parliamentary elections
until women have obtained the Parliamentary vote.</p>
</div>

<p>All the prominent members of the W. S. P. U.
who had not already done so now formally severed
their connexion with the political parties to which
they had at one time belonged. During the past
year a useful little weekly paper entitled <i>Women's
Franchise</i> had been started by Mr. and Mrs.
Francis as the joint organ of the various Suffrage
Societies, and in the month of October, 1907, <i>Votes
for Women</i>, the organ of the Women's Social and
Political Union, was first issued as a monthly paper,
by Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence. Our members
at once volunteered to sell it in the streets, and were
soon turning themselves into sandwich women and
parading about with its contents bills slung from
their shoulders, riding on horseback through Piccadilly
with its posters hanging from the saddle, selling
it from decorated busses and carriages, canvassing
for subscribers and advertisers for it and
evolving a hundred and one devices to increase its
sale. As a result of these efforts both its size and
circulation increased rapidly. In May, 1908, it became
a penny weekly paper, and in the beginning of
the year 1909 its circulation had risen to between
30,000 and 50,000 copies weekly, and it was handed
over by Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence to the Union itself
as a paying concern.</p>

<p>On October 5th a Woman's Suffrage procession
was organised in Edinburgh by the Militant and
Non-Militant Women's Suffragist Societies, and
some four thousand women from all parts of Scotland
assembled under the shadow of Arthur's Seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and, cheered by upwards of a hundred thousand people
who had gathered to see them, marched thence
to the Synod Hall, where there was held a crowded
demonstration which overflowed into the Pillar
Hall.</p>

<div id="Illus04" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Selling and advertising "Votes for Women" in Kingsway</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was in Edinburgh
at the time, and was asked to receive a deputation
from the processionists, but, though this was
backed by many influential Scotswomen, he refused.
When on October 22nd, he spoke at Dunfermline, in
his own constituency, the Premier was obliged, as
Scotch "heckling" is a recognised institution, to reply
to the questioning of women as well as of men.
He was asked: "As the Prime Minister believes in
Women's Suffrage, would he suggest some fresh
methods which we could adopt in order to gain our
enfranchisement?"</p>

<p>He replied: "I think women ought to go on agitating,
holding meetings and pestering as much as
they can, as all other men and women who are interested
in public questions have to do." Whatever
this piece of advice may have been intended to suggest,
it certainly sounded very much like a justification
of the policy of "pestering" members of the
Government at their meetings.</p>

<p>For six months the Suffragettes had devoted themselves
to strengthening and extending their organisation,
electioneering, the distribution of literature
and the holding of propaganda meetings of which,
between May and October, some 3,000 had taken
place, including a demonstration in Boggart Hole
Clough, Manchester, attended by 15,000 people, another
in Stevenson Square, Manchester, attended
by 20,000 people, and meetings in Hyde Park each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sunday at many of which the audiences had numbered
upwards of 12,000. Nevertheless the question
of Votes for Women, which had bulked so
largely in the papers whilst the militant tactics had
been in full swing, had almost entirely disappeared
from the Press during these latter months and anyone
who judged from the newspapers alone might
well have imagined that the agitation had died
down. This fact, together with the Government's
continued refusal even to consider the question of
granting Votes to Women, was enough, without the
Prime Minister's curiously provocative statement, to
convince the Suffragettes that the time had come to
recommence an active militant campaign, and from
this time onward a Cabinet Minister's Meeting was
invaded on almost every day until Parliament met
in the new year. Again and again members of our
Union, with a courage and perseverance which too
few people have ever recognised, presented themselves
at these meetings, and, having asked their
question or made their protest, were rudely set upon
by crowds of stewards and flung fiercely and violently
out into the street.</p>

<p>Many outsiders preferred to look upon the women
who faced this violence as being harder and less sensitive
or as differing in some other way from the rest
of their sex, but this was not by any means the case.
Many of those who bore the worst brunt of the
battle were women who had hitherto taken no part
in politics, and had always led quiet and sheltered
lives. Others had had to fight hard for their livelihood.
Indeed they were of all ages and of all classes.
Week by week greater numbers of them were joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the Union and coming forward to take a part in
this work; but young and old, rich and poor, were
treated in the same way. Meanwhile Cabinet Ministers
either expressed surprised and horrified disapproval
of their behaviour or sought instead to
cover them with ridicule. Mr. Sidney Buxton, at
his meeting at Poplar on October 12th cynically
called to his women questioners, whom the stewards
were maltreating, to "behave decorously like men."
That old self-styled "friend" of Women's Suffrage,
Mr. Haldane, addressing a meeting of women
Liberals in Glasgow on January 8th, 1908, devoted
the greater part of his speech to condemning the
Suffragettes, saying that men did not like to be
fought with "pin pricks," and that, though women
might "wage war," he should advise them "not to
do it with bodkins." At a meeting in his own constituency,
shortly afterwards, he insisted that the
women who interrupted him should be ejected by the
police, and when finally, with bruised and aching
limbs and torn and dishevelled clothing, they had
all been thrown out of the hall, he treated the whole
matter as a joke saying that he was "bachelor-proof
against these belles." Mr. Asquith, like the Prime
Minister, was forced to reply to a question put to
him in his own Scotch constituency, at Tayport, on
October 29th. There he said that, if the vote were
granted to women it would do "more harm than
good," and that in any case, the House of Commons
is not elected on a basis of Universal Suffrage,
for "children are not represented there." At several
meetings, notably those of Mr. Asquith at
Nuneaton on November 16th, and of Mr. Winston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Churchill in the historic Free Trade Hall, the
stewards behaved with so much brutality that the
police intervened to protect the women.</p>

<p>But though at these gatherings of Liberal partisans
the women were usually flung outside without
delay, there were still some occasions on which the
audience rallied round them. Incidents of this
kind occurred when Mr. Herbert Gladstone, now
frequently nicknamed "the prison Secretary," spoke
in his constituency in Leeds on November 21st and
22nd. On the first night the audience prevented
the ejection of women questioners, and on the second
Mr. Gladstone was howled down by both men and
women, and next morning the papers stated in
startling headlines that the Home Secretary had been
"put to flight." Mr. Lewis Harcourt, the first
Commissioner of Works, had a similar experience
in his constituency, the Rossendale Valley, on October
28th. During the day he declared to a deputation of
women that he was opposed to their cause "because
he was." At his evening meeting women protested
again so vigorously and in such numbers that it was
broken up, and his departing audience flocked to hear
Mrs. Pankhurst, who was speaking from a waggon
outside the hall. On November 22nd Mr. Lloyd
George stated to a deputation of the Members of
the old non-Militant Glasgow and West of Scotland
Association for Women's Suffrage that votes
could not be granted to women until the subject of
their enfranchisement had been made a test question
at a General Election, and disposed of the contention
that this had already been done, because over
four hundred Members of Parliament out of 670 returned
at the last General Election had been pledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to support Women's Suffrage, by saying that these
pledges did not count because they had not been
made to constituents. As unenfranchised women
were no man's constituents, Mr. Lloyd George, therefore,
evidently saw no harm in the breaking of
promises that had been made to them, and he gave
no indication as to how, whilst neither political party
was prepared to put votes for women upon its
programme, women were to make their franchise a
test question at election times, except either by obtaining
pledges from individual members or by attacking
the Government in power as the Suffragettes
were doing. He yet went on to say that he should
oppose "very strenuously any legislation that excluded
any class of women from its scope, and any
measure to enfranchise women that would not give
to the working man's wife as much voice in the making
of the laws of the country as her husband possessed."
This meant, of course, that Mr. Lloyd
George would "strenuously oppose" the Women's
Enfranchisement Bill to give women the vote on the
same terms as those upon which it had already been
or might in the future be granted to men, but he did
not seem to realise that if he meant what he said and
wished to act with honesty, fairness and consistency
towards this great question, he ought strenuously to
oppose the status quo, which not only refused a
voice in the making of the laws which governed her
to the wife of the working man but to every other
woman beside.</p>

<p>On December 19th a strange drama was played
out in Aberdeen. The Liberal officials of the town,
had succeeded in inducing the Suffragettes to promise
not to interrupt Mr. Asquith, if he would answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the question of one woman, and they had
begged Mrs. Black, the President of the local
Women's Liberal Federation, to be the woman.
Mrs. Black had agreed "in the interests of peace,"
as she said. When she rose up to comply with the
Liberal official's request, however, she was howled
at by their enthusiastic followers in the audience,
threatened by the stewards of the meeting, and told
by the chairman that she was "out of order," almost
as though she had been a real Suffragette.
Though at last she succeeded in putting her question,
Mr. Asquith replied in snappish and hostile
manner. Mr. Alexander Webster, a Unitarian
Minister and well known citizen of Aberdeen, a
slender, elderly figure, with long grey hair and the
face of a saint, was afterwards violently handled
for trying to move a women's suffrage rider to the
official resolution. Finally Mrs. Pankhurst, who
was seated at the back of the hall, rose to explain
the situation to the curious and excited audience, and
was immediately thrown out of the hall. Then the
meeting broke up in disorder. As the <i>Aberdeen
Free Press</i> put it, "Many a Liberal left the meeting
with the uneasy feeling that the Suffragettes had
had the best of it." Nevertheless the Suffragettes
were loudly censured for these incidents especially
by those who had consistently boycotted the Suffrage
question when women had worked quietly for
it in the old days. In reply to the critics Dr. George
Cooper, an honest Radical and Member of Parliament
for Bermondsey, in the course of a letter to
the <i>Daily News</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My political life began as a member of the Reform League.
It is within my recollection that in 1867 and also in 1884<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
very few public speakers who were opposed to the extension
of the Parliamentary franchise to men, whether members of
the Cabinet or otherwise, could utter a single word at a
public meeting. Meetings were broken up, platforms
stormed and their occupants had to escape the best way they
could. In 1884 every Tory speaker used against the extension
of the franchise the same arguments now used by some
Liberal speakers and newspapers against the extension of the
Parliamentary franchise to women.... Why should
women be condemned for using the same weapons men
found so useful when demanding the vote for themselves?...
Cabinet Ministers do not recognise antagonists using
any other. There is one fact which cannot be denied. The
activity of the Suffragettes has lifted the Women's franchise
Bill out of the category of amusing and frivolous debate into
that of a serious political question.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Suffragettes were fighting at two
more by-elections. The first of these was at Hull,
where polling took place on November 29th, the
result being that the Liberal vote was reduced from
8,652 to 5,623, and the Liberal majority from 2,247
to 241. The second of these contests, one of the
most striking at which the W. S. P. U. has ever
fought, was at Mid-Devon. In each of the seven
elections that had occurred in this constituency since
its creation in 1885 a Liberal candidate had been
returned, the majority on the last occasion having
numbered 1,289 votes. The Suffragettes at once
opened Committee Rooms in the main street of
Newton Abbot, the principal town in the division,
and published a manifesto calling upon every elector
who wished to see fair play for women to vote
against the Liberal candidate, and concluding "We
want votes for women this year. Defeat the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in Mid-Devon as a message that women are
to have votes in 1908."</p>

<p>The contest was a very trying one for the workers,
for, in addition to the extensive area covered by
the constituency, it took place in a season of heavy
snow falls and bitter winds which came driving in
from the sea. Besides this there was a most turbulent
variety of human nature to contend with.
The Mid-Devon Elections had always been notorious
for their violent character and the roughs of
Newton Abbot had long been a byword in the district.
Early in the campaign the speakers representing
both candidates were frequently howled down
and were unable to continue their meetings, and,
though on the whole we fared very much better,
we ourselves had some similar experiences. On one
occasion some of the Conservatives had arranged to
speak at a place called Bovey Tracey, but they fled
away on being told that the Liberals of the town
were not only preparing to break up the meetings
of their opponents but had even built a cage in
which to imprison them. On the same day three
young members of our Union had also appeared in
Bovey Tracey. They too were warned of the terrible
cage, but decided to hold their meetings in spite
of it. All went well and they were told by the men
who met to hear them that they had no desire to
injure those who trusted them, and that the cage
had only been built for cowards. On one occasion
it happened that Mr. Buxton, the Liberal candidate,
and the Suffragettes held simultaneous school-room
meetings in the same village. The Liberal meetings
had been advertised several days beforehand, but
though ours was arranged on the spur of the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
all the people came to our meeting and not a single
person turned up to hear him.</p>

<p>As time went on the state of the district became
more and more turbulent and the great party newspapers,
the London <i>Tribune</i>, <i>Daily News</i>, and others,
sought to stir up the wildest and most unrestrained
element in the constituency. The <i>Daily News</i>
hailed with enthusiasm the formation of what was
known as the "League of Young Liberals," which
was in reality a gang of young roughs whose first
act was to push a policeman through the plate glass
window of the shop which served as our Committee
Rooms. This and other violent acts were described
by the <i>Daily News</i> as "diverting incidents with the
Suffragettes," but the special correspondent of the
<i>Daily Mail</i>, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Miss Mary Gawthorpe, who usually has no difficulty in
maintaining good-humoured relations with audiences of every
class, was not only compelled to hear language from some of
the Newton Abbot Liberal partisans that brought a flush
to her face and tears into her eyes, but had to resist by
force the efforts of one man to mount the waggon from which
she and several other ladies were speaking. And the most
pitiful part of the business was that the language and the
conduct seemed to be regarded by their perpetrators as engaging
little gallantries, appropriate to be offered to a lady.</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later the roughs dragged the lorry in
which our women were speaking round and round
with such violence that it was feared that it would
be overturned, and they only stopped when a little
boy had been run over and trampled upon and seriously
injured. Still the Liberal politicians made
no protest. Mr. Buxton's reply to a newspaper correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
who asked him what he thought of the
disorder was: "You must remember that they are
keen politicians down here. From the fact that
Mid-Devon has had three elections within the space
of four years the people have necessarily heard a
great deal about politics."</p>

<p>So the contest went on&mdash;Liberals and Conservatives
smashing up each other's meetings, howling
each other down, pelting each other with vegetables
from the market and snowballing each other on Dartmoor.
The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> for January 10th,
writing in regard to a Liberal meeting, threatened
that, if the Unionists were not admitted, the building
would be stormed.</p>

<p>When on January 17th the poll was declared it
was found that the Liberal candidate had been defeated.
Everyone was surprised except the Suffragettes.
The figures were:</p>

<p class="no-indent">At the General Election the figures had been:</p>

    <td class="tdr tdb">5,079</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl tdpr">Liberal Majority</td>
    <td class="tdr tdb">1,280</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>After the declaration of the poll Mrs. Pankhurst
and Mrs. Martel, the only members of the Suffragette
band left in the storm centre of Newton Abbot,
saw Captain Morrison Bell escorted from the
Market Square by a strong force of police, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
themselves urged to hurry away and leave the town
at once. The warning seemed to them absurd, and
Mrs. Pankhurst laughingly said that she had never
yet been afraid to trust herself in a crowd. Immediately
afterwards she and her companion met a
procession of young men and boys wearing the Liberal
colours, who were hurrying from their work in
the clay pits. As soon as they heard that the Liberal
had been defeated, one of them pointed to Mrs.
Pankhurst and Mrs. Martel: "Those women have
done it." Then the whole crowd of them started
running and from somewhere or other there came a
shower of rotten eggs. The two women were completely
taken by surprise, and, more anxious to avoid
the eggs than the angry crowd, they rushed into a
grocer's shop, whilst a big brewer's drayman, who
had been standing by jumped into the doorway and
fought their assailants off until they were safe. The
men and boys outside howled as their prey escaped
them, and the people to whom the shop belonged,
though anxious to protect the women, cried out despairingly
that the windows would be broken in.
Mrs. Pankhurst at once said that she could not bear
to be the cause of loss to those who had sheltered
her, and at her own request she and Mrs. Martel
were led through a back door and across a yard
leading to a narrow lane behind, whence it was
thought that they would be able to escape. As soon
as the door had been shut upon them, their assailants
who had guessed their movements came rushing up.
Mrs. Martel was seized by one who caught her by
the throat and began to beat her about the head,
but in a flash the shopkeeper's wife had heard the
noise and had opened the door again and, somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
or other, she and Mrs. Pankhurst had rescued Mrs.
Martel and had dragged her into the yard. The
door was shut and safely bolted in all haste, but just
as it closed, a man struck Mrs. Pankhurst a heavy
blow on the back of the head, and, as she staggered
on the threshold, pulled her back and she was left
outside. Then the men gave an angry shout, and
one of them, seizing her by the collar of her coat and
by her wrists, flung her to the ground. She caught
a glimpse of them all rushing on her, then for a time
she knew nothing until she felt the wet mud soaking
through her clothes. There was a pause. As she
lay there looking at them, she saw that they had all
closed round her in a ring, and that in the centre
was an empty barrel. "Are they going to put me
into it?" The thought flashed through her mind.
Hours seemed to pass as she watched them, all
dressed in drab-coloured clothes, smeared with yellow
clay, and every one wearing a red Liberal
rosette. They all seemed to be puny half-grown
youths, and without knowing why she did so, she
asked, "Are there no men here?" For an instant
they still stood. Then one of them came forward,
and she felt that whatever was to be done to her was
about to begin, but suddenly there was a shout, and
the police came galloping up with a crowd of rescuers
at their heels. Her assailants turned tail, and
she was lifted up and carried back through the yard
into the shop. A large force of police now surrounded
the premises, but a great crowd had assembled,
and it was two hours before a motor car
could be brought through it and the women were
able to get away. The disorder did not end here,
for the rowdies flocked thence to the Conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Club, smashed every one of its windows, and
kept its members besieged there all through the
night. Next morning the body of Sergeant Major
Rendall of the Royal Marines, an ex-Instructor of
the Newton Abbot College, was found in the mill
race. Foul play was suspected, as he had been
severely bruised about the head. Throughout this
violent disturbance not a single arrest was made.
During the whole course of the election but one man
was fined five shillings and costs for assaulting one of
his political opponents. Well indeed might the
Suffragettes say that the treatment meted out to them
was very different from that extended to men who
were fighting on the Government side.</p>

<p>As a result of the attack which had been made
upon her, Mrs. Pankhurst was unable to walk for
some considerable time, and her ankle was so
severely injured that it gave her trouble for more
than a year, whilst owing to the treatment she received
Mrs. Martel will probably always bear a
scar upon her neck. Scarcely a word of regret for
the violence which had been done to these two women
ever appeared in the Liberal newspapers, who were
so largely to blame for what had occurred. After the
election was over the Conservative politicians
claimed that they alone had kept out the Liberal
and the Liberals also preferred to attribute their
defeat to the Tariff Reformers rather than to the
Suffragettes. Only one of the Liberal newspapers,
the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> admitted both during and
after the election that the woman's question had
played a decisive part. The Special Correspondent
of this paper, in the issue of January 20th,
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I think there can be no doubt that the Suffragettes did
influence votes. Their activity, the interest shown in their
meetings, the success of their persuasive methods in enlisting
the popular sympathy, the large number of working women
who acted with them as volunteers, these were features of
the election which, although strangely ignored by most of
the newspapers, must have struck most visitors to the constituency.</p>
</div>

<p>An amusing proof that the Liberals in the district
had considered the Suffragettes to be very formidable
opponents came to light in the following mock
mourning card which had been got out in expectation
of the Liberal victory.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Incidents in the Votes for Women campaign
now followed each other with such rapidity that they
defy the chronicler who wishes to note them down.
Because vigorous militancy was the order of the day,
the Press teemed with articles upon the abstract
question of Votes for Women and with notices
of the doings of the Suffragettes. "SUFFRAGETTES
IN DOWNING STREET,"
"CABINET BAITING AS THE LATEST
RUSE," "SUFFRAGETTES IN CHAINS."
These and others of the same nature, were the
startling headlines that one saw in the evening papers
on January 17th and in the morning papers of the
following day. It was merely that Mrs. Drummond
and a number of other members of our Union,
knowing that the Cabinet was sitting to decide upon
the questions which should find a place in the legislative
programme of the forthcoming session had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
made an attempt to urge upon them the necessity of
dealing with the women's claim.</p>

<p>Whilst Press representatives were congregating
in Downing Street, to snapshot the Ministers and
to gain material for foolish paragraphs describing
their appearance and manner of arrival at the first
Cabinet Council of the Season, and whilst police
were assembling to dance attendance upon the Prime
Minister and his colleagues, three or four of the
Women appeared to demand an interview. The
police pulled them aside and the Cabinet Ministers
brushed past as they tried to speak, and when they
applied at the door of the official residence, no
notice was taken. Then Miss New, well knowing
that her words would be heard both inside the House
and by the crowd that was collecting in the street,
began to make a speech explaining what she and
her friends had come for. Before beginning, she
chained herself to the railings beside the Prime
Minister's front door, both symbolically to express
the political bondage of womanhood, and for the
very practical reason that this device would prevent
her being dragged speedily away. Her example
was followed by Nurse Olivia Smith and, whilst the
police were struggling to break the double set of
chains, a taxicab drove up and stopped on the opposite
side of the street. Suspecting more Suffragettes,
some of the constables rushed to the door
of the cab which opened on to the pavement. At
the same moment, Mrs. Drummond (for it was
she who had devised this stratagem), opened the
cab door on the road side and bounded across to
the sacred Residence, where, as there was no one to
bar her progress and as she now possessed the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the little knob in the centre of the door, she was
inside and very near to the Council Chamber itself,
before a number of men, some of whom she believed
to be Cabinet Ministers, though owing to the violent
and hurried nature of her ejection it was impossible
to make quite sure, rushed upon her, and
she was flung out and hurled down the steps. She
was then arrested, and shortly afterwards she and
four of her comrades found themselves before Sir
Albert de Rutzen at Bow Street Police Court,
charged with disorderly conduct. They were found
guilty and on refusing to be bound, were sent to
prison for three weeks. Instead of placing them
in the first division, as had been done in the case
of all the Suffragettes since the transfer of Mrs.
Cobden Sanderson and the rest of us had taken place
in October, 1906, the authorities reverted to the old
plan of putting them in the second class.</p>

<p>On January 29th the King opened Parliament in
great state, and four members of the Women's Freedom
League rushed in to the Royal Procession and
attempted to present him with a Petition, but were
dragged back and hustled aside by the soldiery and
police. The King's speech did not contain any mention
of Votes for Women, and the Women's Social
and Political Union was already preparing to confer
upon the subject at a Women's Parliament to be held
in the Caxton Hall on February 11th, 12th, and 13th.
In the meantime the Members of the Women's
Freedom League had determined to make an immediate
protest, and the day after the opening of Parliament
they set out to interview six members of the
Cabinet. Three of the ladies, Dr. Helen Bourchier,
Mrs. Kennindale Cook, a well known novelist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Miss Munro, a Scotchwoman from Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman's constituency, visited Mr.
Haldane at his house at Queen Anne's Gate at
9:30. They agreed with the butler to wait outside
until Mr. Haldane could see them, but the Secretary
of State for War telephoned to the police, who soon
appeared in force and placed the women under arrest.
The same sort of thing happened at the houses
of Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Harcourt and Captain
Sinclair. Altogether seven women were arrested and
sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from
two to six weeks.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day Mr. Asquith
received a deputation from the National Union of
Women's Suffrage Societies. He then definitely said
that the Government would not introduce a Vote
for Women measure on their own account and also
refused to hold out any hope that the Government
would allow of the passage of a private Member's
Bill. As they left the Treasury offices the so-called
"Constitutional" Suffragists agreed that Mr. Asquith's
remarks would merely serve <i>to incite the Suffragettes
to further militancy</i>.</p>

<p>They judged rightly, for the next day nine members
of the Women's Freedom League called at Mr.
Asquith's house at No. 20, Cavendish Square, and,
on being refused an interview with him, decorated
his area railings with "Votes for Women"
banners and bills, and, using his topmost doorstep
as a platform, proceeded to address a crowd of some
seventy persons that had collected. Four arrests
were the result. The women were brought
up before Mr. Plowden at Marylebone Police Court
and claimed the right to speak in their own defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
but Dr. Helen Bourchier, the first who uttered a
word, was stopped by the would-be witty Mr.
Plowden, who said rudely "Behave yourself!
You are the bell-wether of the flock." He then
declared all the women guilty of obstruction, and
ordered them either to pay fines of forty shillings
or to undergo one month's imprisonment in the
Second Division, saying that he wanted them to understand
that if they thought the punishment light,
it was because it was all that the Law allowed him
to give them, and adding "I do not consider it by
any means a fair measure of your deserts."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reversion to the policy of treating
the Suffragettes as ordinary criminals instead of
according to them the treatment usually meted out
to political prisoners, was being raised in both
Houses of Parliament. Earl Russell and others
urged the Government that "the blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the Church," but the Government
were deaf alike to appeal and warning.</p>

<p>The Women's Social and Political Union had long
realised this, and when the third Women's Parliament
met in the Caxton Hall on February 11th,
1908, it did so with all the splendid courage and
enthusiasm for militant action that had characterised
its predecessors. It was now known that an excellent
place in the private Members ballot had been
won, and on the Women's Bill, by Mr. Stanger, a
Liberal, and it was realised that before February
28th, when the Bill was to come up for second
reading, strong pressure must be brought to bear
upon the Government to prevent this Bill being
wrecked as that of Mr. Dickinson had been in the
previous year. It was therefore with an added sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of immediate pressing necessity that the women set
out unflinchingly for the old hard fight with overwhelming
force. The motion to carry the usual
resolution to the Prime Minister was moved by Miss
Marie Naylor and Miss Florence Haig both London
Members of the Union and both Chelsea portrait
painters, and then the whole Hall seemed to rock
with the noise of the cheers as the majority of the
women present sprang up to form a deputation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an extraordinary scene had taken place
close to the Strangers' Entrance to the House of
Commons. It had been anticipated, of course, that
the Suffragettes would make an attempt to lay their
Resolution before the Prime Minister and a great
force of Police was massed in readiness before the
House. Just about four o'clock as the long lines of
men in their dark-blue uniform waited there, two
furniture removal vans slowly approached, coming up
Victoria Street and round by the green which surrounds
the Abbey and St. Margaret's Church, as
though they were about to make their way past the
House of Commons and along Millbank towards the
Tate Gallery and Westminster Embankment. The
first van went slowly by the House, the second
crawled leisurely in its wake and along the back ledge
of the second van lay a sleepy-looking boy, his eyes
idly fixed upon a little man sauntering along the
pavement some distance away. Just as this van
was passing the Strangers' Entrance the little man
dropped a handkerchief, then suddenly the boy
sprang from the ledge, the back doors of the van
flew open wide, and one-and-twenty women plunged
out and made a rush for the House of Commons.
They were blinded by the broad daylight after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
long ride in the darkness of the van, and as they
jumped, many of them fell on their knees and groping
helplessly, ran the wrong way. Nevertheless there
were some who headed straight for the doorway and
two of them managed to get inside, only to be flung
back instantly, whilst the police closed round and
several arrests were made.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the body of women who had engaged
to carry the Resolution to the Prime Minister, had
emerged from the Caxton Hall, and having formed
up four abreast in orderly procession, had begun to
move quietly forward towards the House of Commons.
Large crowds had gathered to see them
whilst the police were drawn up on either side of
the road, and at one point formed a line across the
thoroughfare. The constables pushed and jostled
the women for some time without altogether preventing
their passage, but at Broad Sanctuary, a large
contingent of police entirely blocked the way. Undaunted,
the women pressed forward, and the
crowds, some with the idea of helping the Suffragettes,
others from curiosity, pressed forward too.
The police charged again and again, and there was
grave danger that someone would be trampled under
foot. When at last the streets were cleared, it
was found that some fifty women had been arrested,
amongst these Miss Marie Naylor and Miss Florence
Haig, Georgina and Marie Brackenbury, both of
them painters, and nieces of General Sir Henry
Brackenbury, and Miss Maud Joachim, niece of the
great violinist.</p>

<p>The Suffragette cases came on next morning before
Mr. Horace Smith at the Westminster Police
Court, Mr. Muskett, who prosecuted on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the police, then announced that on this occasion
the authorities had decided as before to prosecute
under the Prevention of Crimes Amendment Act of
1885, which enabled the Magistrate to inflict a fine
of £5 or, in default, to order imprisonment with
or without hard labour for two months. Throwing
down a remarkable challenge to the women, he
added that there were greater and stronger powers
in reserve which could be enforced to put down disorder,
for there was still upon the Statute Book
an Act passed in the reign of Charles II which dealt
with "Tumultuous Petitions either to the Crown or
Parliament." He recalled the fact that it had
been stated by the judge at the time of the Lord
George Gordon riots that that Act was still good
law, and, he said, that the dictum still applied. The
Act of Charles II provided that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>No person whatever shall repair to His Majesty or both
or either of the Houses of Parliament upon pretence of presenting
or delivering any petition, complaint, remonstrance
or declaration or other address accompanied with an excessive
number of people, nor at any one time with above the
number of twelve persons.</p>
</div>

<p>Penalties might be enforced under this Act up to
a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment. In
holding forth this threat to women who might
demonstrate in the future, Mr. Muskett again appealed
to the Magistrate to deal with those who
were now charged with all the rigour which he
would apply to ordinary law-breakers.</p>

<p>The prisoners were then one by one brought in.
Georgina Brackenbury, tall, fair, and well featured,
was the first to be put into the dock. The Magistrate
affected to take scant interest in the case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in spite of her own splendid courtesy of manner, addressed
her with pettish rudeness, and finally interrupted
her statement with "That is all nonsense."
The whole of the proceedings were conducted in
the same spirit. But two women out of the fifty
had been imprisoned before, and these two, Mrs.
Rigby, the wife of a doctor in Preston, and Mrs.
Titterington, as "old offenders," were ordered
either to pay fines of £5 or to suffer one month's
imprisonment in the third and lowest class. The
other forty-seven women were ordered to be bound
over in two sureties of £20 to keep the peace for
twelve months or to serve six weeks' imprisonment in
the second Division. With the exception of two,
whose absence from home was found to be impossible
owing to the serious illness of relatives, all the
women chose imprisonment.</p>

<p>All these things were of course largely discussed
in the Press. The furniture van incident attracted
the greatest attention, and the van itself was likened
by almost every newspaper to the wooden horse of
Troy. The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Suffragettes are essentially heroic. First they lash
themselves to the Premier's railings; now borrowing an idea
from the Trojan horse, they burst forth from a pantechnicon
van.... A high standard of artifice has been set and
it should be maintained. The Trojan horse would have
been of no use if it had remained outside the walls, and
though curiosity could never be expected to prompt Members
to drag a deserted pantechnicon into the House, there
must be occasions when a large-sized packing case is taken
into St. Stephen's.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> called for a poet
of Hudibrastic gifts to rise and embody in heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
verse the deeds of the Suffragettes, and asserted that
"The daring attack yesterday evening on that
citadel of democratic liberty, the House of Commons,
is of itself sufficient to inspire a Homer, or
at least a Peter Pindar." The <i>Evening News</i> said
that until the Suffragettes had outwitted the policemen
by the use of the furniture van, they had never
believed in the story of the Trojan horse, now they
knew it to be quite possible after all.</p>

<p>In the Women's Parliament it was the more serious
side of the case that appealed to us. We saw
that the Government were preparing still further to
resist our just and moderate demands, and rather
than concede them were even ready to revive ancient
coercive Statutes which the customs and principles
of modern times had caused to fall into disuse.
This Act of Charles II, with which they had threatened
us, had originally been passed to obstruct
the growth of the Liberal Party, which first
came into existence in Stuart times. It was the
political descendants of those very Liberals who
would now use this coercive Statute against their
countrywomen. Well might Christabel Pankhurst
ask in the Women's Parliament, "What would have
been said if a Tory Government had done this
thing?" "This takes us back to stirring times,
ladies," she told the women. "At last it is realised
that women are fighting for freedom as their fathers
fought.... If they want twelve women, aye,
and more than twelve, if a hundred women are
wanted to be tried under that Act and to be sent
to prison for three months they can be found."</p>

<p>There was no militant demonstration on that day,
but everyone knew that something more was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
happen, and on Thursday afternoon, the 13th of
February, when the Women's Parliament met for its
concluding session, a feeling of most extraordinary
excitement prevailed. Mrs. Pankhurst had just returned
from the by-election at South Leeds, and the
audience listened eagerly to her account of the campaign,
and especially to the story of the torchlight
procession and the wonderful meeting of 100,000
people on Hunslett Moor. In spite of the fact that
police protection had been refused at the last moment,
there had been no disorder, only sympathy and
enthusiasm all along the route, whilst the vast crowds
that parted to let the procession through had joined
on to it and added to its numbers from behind, and
some of the women had constantly called out in
broad Yorkshire: "Shall us have the vote?" to be
answered by others with cries of "we shall."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I have come to London, Mrs. Pankhurst concluded,
feeling, as I have never felt before, the seriousness of this
struggle. I feel that the time has come when I must act,
and I wish to volunteer to be one of those to carry our Resolution
to Parliament this afternoon. My experience in the
country and especially in South Leeds has taught me things
that Cabinet Ministers who have not that experience do not
know, and has made me feel that I must make one final
attempt to see them and to urge them to reconsider their
position before some terrible disaster has occurred.</p>
</div>

<p>Then, amid some emotional excitement and cries
of "Mrs Pankhurst must not go," "We cannot
spare our leader"&mdash;cries which were calmly set
aside by practical business-like Christabel, who announced
that the deputation was definitely chosen and
that its thirteen members were all prepared to be arrested
and tried under the Charles II Act&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Resolution was carried and Mrs. Pankhurst, Annie
Kenney, and eleven other women marched out of
the hall, whilst almost the whole of the audience
flocked into the corridor and stood around the doorway
to watch them go.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pankhurst had been lamed in the cowardly
attack that had been made upon her at Mid-Devon,
and had not yet recovered. Seeing this Mrs. Drummond
ran forward to get a conveyance. She saw
none for hire, but called to a man in a private dog-cart
and asked him if he would drive Mrs. Pankhurst
to the House of Commons. He agreed, and
the other women formed up on foot behind the
vehicle two and two abreast. The police were already
massed around in great force and the little
procession had moved but a few slow steps when
a Police Inspector came forward and insisted that
Mrs. Pankhurst should dismount. She instantly
obeyed the order, signing to her companions not to
protest. The twelve women of the deputation at
the same time hurried forward to re-form in double
line behind their leader, but the Inspector and his
men dragged them apart. Then the deputation,
hemmed in by men, women and police on every side,
proceeded in single file as far as Chapel Street.
There the Inspector said they must not walk in procession.
They therefore broke into twos and threes,
but when they came to the entrance of Victoria
Street the police entirely barred the way, and it was
only after a considerable struggle that they were
able to gain the main thoroughfare. There a
vast concourse of people had assembled and right
in the midst of it one saw Mrs. Pankhurst wearing
a long loose cloak whose light grey colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
made her figure stand out from the darkly clad
men around. She came forward with Mrs. Baldock
clinging to her arm, and tall, pretty, smiling young
Gladice Keevil, her face a little flushed and her soft
hair blowing a little in the wind, walking on the
other side, and with the great crowd following and
filling the whole street around.</p>

<p>Scattered amongst the people behind and moving
forward either singly or in twos, the rest of the
deputation followed. Close to Westminster Palace
Hotel Mrs. Pankhurst, who up to this point had
followed in the wake of a Police Inspector and
carefully obeyed all the instructions of the police,
was arrested and taken through Parliament Square
on the side furthest from the House in the strong
grip of two burly policemen. Clad in her heavy
travelling cloak, her face had grown white with exhaustion,
and she was evidently in pain, but no heed
was paid to her lameness, and she was hurried along
at a brisk trot, and at last disappeared down the
narrow lane at the top of Bridge Street which leads
to Canon Row Police Station. Mrs. Baldock and
Gladice Keevil, who had refused to leave her, had
for this cause been arrested and almost immediately
afterwards Annie Kenney was also taken into custody.
Later on the same fate befell Mrs. Kerwood
of Birmingham and five others, some of whom were
not members of the deputation.</p>

<p>Whilst this was happening, the Women's Parliament
was still in session, and every now and then
someone returned from the battle to describe how
events were going. Before the meeting closed our
ever thoughtful Treasurer, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence,
urged all not on the fighting line to subscribe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
war chest. More than £400 had been raised when
the prisoners came back to us on bail at the rising of
Parliament.</p>

<div id="Illus05" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mrs. Pankhurst carrying a petition from the Third Women's Parliament to the Prime Minister
on February 13th, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the House of Commons itself the Government's
hostile attitude towards the Suffragettes was raised
as a matter of urgency on the motion for the adjournment,
by Sir William Bull, the Unionist member
for Hammersmith, who showed genuine concern at
the news of Mrs. Pankhurst's arrest. Other members
of the same Party followed by jeering at the
Government for the marked difference between their
treatment of the Suffragist women and the men who
had been arrested for cattle driving and similar offences
in Ireland. Why was Mr. Ginnell, the Nationalist
Member for Westmeath, to receive the privileges
of a first class misdemeanant, they asked,
whilst Mrs. Pankhurst and her comrades were to
be treated as ordinary criminals. Lord Robert
Cecil raised a laugh against the President of the
Local Government Board, by pointing out that
when he, Mr. John Burns, had been in prison for
inciting to riot, the Government of the day had intervened
to secure preferential treatment for him.
In reply to all this Mr. Gladstone refused to take
any action, saying that the women could come out
of prison whenever they liked.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Pankhurst and her comrades were
brought up at Westminster Police Court before Mr.
Horace Smith, next day, it was found that the authorities,
who were perhaps disappointed at the
way in which their challenge had been accepted, had
changed their minds and instead of prosecuting the
women as they had threatened under the Charles II
Act, had decided to revert to the old method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
stigmatising the whole affair as a mere vulgar brawl
with the Police. Probably thinking the true facts
would arouse too much public sympathy, the prosecution
put forward as evidence an absolute tissue
of falsehood, in which it was stated that the deputation
had set out from the Caxton Hall singing and
shouting in the noisiest manner and that they had
knocked off the helmets of the police and had assaulted
them right and left. As we have seen everything
had been done most quietly, and Mrs. Pankhurst
herself had carefully complied with every order
from the police short of abandoning her intention
to reach the House of Commons. Our rebutting evidence
was disregarded and Mrs. Pankhurst's own
statement in the dock was cut short by Mr. Horace
Smith's saying, "I have nothing to do with that.
It only amounts to another threat to break the law,
and it is in no way relevant here. You, like the
others, must find sureties in £20 for twelve months'
good behaviour or be imprisoned for six weeks in the
Second Division."</p>

<p>Then as usual the women were hurried off in the
van to prison, the Holloway gates were closed upon
them, and the Government settled down to forget
them as far as it could until next time.</p>

<p>February 28th was the day for the discussion of
the Women's Enfranchisement Bill, in moving its
second reading, Mr. H. Y. Stanger, whilst he carefully
dissociated himself from the methods of the
Suffragettes, reminded the House that, if in the
course of a political agitation, excesses were committed,
the authorities should search for the cause of
the discontent and apply an appropriate remedy.
Mr. Cathcart Wason, another Liberal member, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
an anti-Suffragist, declared on the other hand that
the Suffragette movement was founded on riot, and
that the House should not "yield to clamour"; yet
with an entire lack of consistency, he went on to
extol physical force, saying that because in his opinion
women could make no contribution to this, they
ought not to be allowed to vote. Evidently he forgot
that, whilst the whole trend of civilisation has
been in the direction of mental rather than physical
dominance, in the age when physical force was the
governing power, women were actually members of
the legislature and, that they retained the right to
vote for Members of Parliament throughout the
ages when its possession was looked upon as a burden
and until, having become a privilege, it was wrested
from them. But all this talk was mere word spinning.
It was a pronouncement from the Government
benches, that was eagerly awaited. As last time,
it was Mr. Herbert Gladstone who spoke, and for
the Ministry, and he soon disclosed the fact that the
Government was still determined to make no move.
It was the old story of opposition in the Cabinet and
the old excuse that no party in the House was united
either for or against the question. As for the Bill
he himself intended to vote for it, for, he said, making
an important admission which his colleagues
might well have taken to heart, "It may be imperfect,
but at any rate <i>it removes a disqualification
and an inequality which have been for so long a deep
source of complaint with great masses of the people
of this country</i>." Then Mr. Gladstone went on to
make some very remarkable statements, of which
both he and the Government were afterwards to be
reminded. He said amongst other things:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Men have had to struggle for centuries for their political
rights.... On the question of Women's Suffrage, experience
shows that predominance of argument alone&mdash;and
I believe that that has been attained&mdash;is not enough to win
the political day.</p>
</div>

<p>In any reform movement, he went on to explain,
various stages had to be gone through; first
there was the stage of "academic discussion," and
the ventilation of "pious opinions" unaccompanied
by "effective action," but after this, he continued,
becoming perhaps a little carried away by his own
words;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Comes the time when political dynamics are far more
important than political argument. You have to move a
great inert mass of opinion which, in the early stages, always
exists in the country in regard to questions of the first magnitude....
Men have learned this lesson and know
the necessity for demonstrating the greatness of their movement
and for establishing that <i>force majeure</i> which actuates
and arms a Government for effective work. That is the
task before the supporters of this great movement....
Looking back at the great political crises in the thirties, the
sixties and the eighties, it will be found that people did not
go about in small crowds, nor were they content with enthusiastic
meetings in large halls; they assembled in their
tens of thousands all over the country.</p>
</div>

<p>"But," said Mr. Gladstone, "of course it is
not to be expected that women can assemble in
such masses," but, "power belongs to the masses and
through this power a Government can be influenced
into more effective action than a Government will
be likely to take under present conditions."</p>

<p>Mr. Rees (Liberal) then made an attempt to talk
out this Bill as he had done that of Mr. Dickinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the year before, and, after firing off all the jokes that
he could think of, he fell back upon the Scriptures,
saying, "Jerusalem is ruined and Judah has fallen.
As for my people, children are their oppressors and
women rule over them.... Because the
daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with
stretched-forth necks, therefore the Lord will smite
with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters
of Zion and in that day the Lord will take away
the bravery of their tinkling ornaments."</p>

<p>But at this point he was interrupted by Lord Robert
Cecil who moved the closure of the debate, and,
on the Speaker's accepting the motion and its being
agreed to without a division, a vote was taken upon
the Bill itself, in which 271 members voted for the
Bill and only ninety-two against. There was therefore
a favourable majority of 179, the largest that
had ever been cast in support of Women's Suffrage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it now appeared that Mr. Stanger
had been informed beforehand that the closure resolution,
which would prevent the talking out of the
Bill, would only be accepted on condition that he,
as the Bill's sponsor, would move that it be referred
to a Committee of the whole House instead of passing
automatically to one of the Grand Committees.
Mr. Stanger had agreed to the condition and now
fulfilled the promise that had been exacted, and the
result was that nothing further could be done with
the Bill unless the Government would provide time
for its discussion.</p>

<p>Had the Cabinet been prepared to act honourably
and to stand by the statement of their spokesman,
Mr. Gladstone, the position would now have been
that, if the women who wanted votes could organise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a series of demonstrations which could compare with
those held by men in support of the various extensions
of the franchise that had already taken place,
the Government would concede their demands and
would either provide time for the passage into law
of Mr. Stanger's Bill or introduce and put through
its various stages a measure of their own framing.
The Women's Social and Political Union were prepared
to accept Mr. Gladstone's challenge.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Pankhurst and the other women had
gone to prison, their comrades of the W. S. P. U.,
at Mrs. Pethick Lawrence's suggestion, had entered
upon a week of self-denial in order to raise funds
for the campaign. The thought of those who were
in prison spurred on every member of the Union
to renewed zeal. Some went canvassing from
house to house for money. Others stood with collecting
boxes at regular pitches in the street. At
the Kensington High Street District Railway Station,
for instance, four well known women writers,
Miss Evelyn Sharpe, Miss May Sinclair, Miss
Violet Hunt, and Miss Clemence Housman, were
gathering in pennies all through those wintry days.
Some women sold flowers, swept crossings, became
pavement artists and played barrel organs. Poorer
members obliged to work continuously for a living,
denied themselves sugar and milk in their tea, butter
on their bread, and walked to and from their
work, in order to be able to give something to the
funds. The result of this week of earnest effort
was to be announced at a great meeting at the Albert
Hall on March 19th, to advertise which a
great box kite, with a flag attached, was hanging over
the Houses of Parliament for a fortnight, whilst a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
similar flag floated over Holloway Gaol to cheer
the prisoners within.</p>

<p>Every seat in the great Albert Hall was sold long
before the day of the meeting, and hundreds of people
were turned away at the doors. The vast audience
was composed almost entirely of women, and
there were 200 women stewards in white dresses.
The platform was decorated with flowers and
thronged with ex-prisoners and the officials of
the Union, but as the sentences of Mrs. Pankhurst
and eight of her comrades were not to expire until
the following morning, the Chairman's seat which
the founder of the Union should have occupied, was
left vacant and in it was placed a large white card
bearing the inscription "Mrs. Pankhurst's chair."</p>

<p>Throughout that great gathering there was a wonderful
spirit of unity and not one woman there could
wish in her heart, as so many millions have done,
"if I had only been a man." No, they were rather
like to pity those who were not women and so could
not join in this great fight, for to-day it was the
woman's battle. The time was gone when she must
always play a minor part, applauding, ministering,
comforting, performing useful functions if you will,
incurring risks, too, and making sacrifices, but always
being treated and always thinking of herself as a
mere incident of the struggle outside the wide main
stream of life. To-day this battle of theirs seemed
to the women to be the greatest in the world, all
other conflicts appeared minor to it. A great wave
of enthusiasm had caught them up and they were
ready to break out into cheers and clapping at the
least excuse. Fate, in the person of the Government,
had provided an incident entirely in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with their mood, for Christabel immediately announced
that Mrs. Pankhurst and the remaining
prisoners had been unexpectedly released, and Mrs.
Pankhurst herself walked quietly on to the platform
to take possession of the vacant chair.</p>

<p>Then it was a wonderful sight to see the up-springing
of those thousands of women from those
rows and rows of seats and tiers and tiers of boxes
and galleries sloping to the roof of the great circular
hall. There was a sea of waving arms and handkerchiefs
and a long chorus of cheers,&mdash;with no
greater welcome could any leader have been met.
The founder of the Union stood there quite still in
her dark grey dress, and her face, usually pale, had
that strangely blanched look, which comes to prisoners.
When, as the applause subsided, she stepped
forward to speak to the assembled women, it was
evident that she was deeply moved by their greeting,
and as she told how the chief wardress had come
to her cell at two o'clock that afternoon to tell her
that an order had come for her immediate release,
one felt that she was very tired and almost overwhelmed
by the sharp contrast between that great
brightly lighted hall, with its vast seething throng
of human beings, and the still silence of the prison
cell. She had heard, she told the women,&mdash;"for
these things filter even into prison"&mdash;that the Bill
had successfully passed its second reading, but she
said, and all present knew that she spoke rightly,
that if ever the Bill were to become an Act, women
must do ten times more yet than they had ever done
in the past.</p>

<p>"I for one, friends," Mrs. Pankhurst cried, and
we knew that she was thinking of the women she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
had seen in prison, "I for one, looking round on
the sweated and decrepit members of my sex, say
that men have had control of these things long
enough and that no woman with any spark of
womanliness in her will consent to allow this state of
things to go on any longer. We are tired of it, we
want to be of use and to have the power to make
the world a better place both for men and women
than it is to-day." She paused then and went on to
express quietly but with deep feeling her joy in this
great woman's movement that a few years before
she had thought she would never live to see. The
old cry had been, "You will never rouse women," but
she said, "we have done what they thought, and
what they hoped, to be impossible; we women are
roused." At those words they stopped her with their
cheers.</p>

<p>Then Annie Kenney rose to tell the story of her
first and only other visit to the Royal Albert Hall,
when she had gone there to ask of the newly elected
and triumphant Liberal Ministry, a pledge for the enfranchisement
of her sex. That night, two years
before, she had been received with cries of abuse and
howled down by an audience of angry men. "There
seemed to be thousands against one," she said, "but
I did not mind because I knew that our action that
night was like summer rain on a drooping flower; it
would give new life to the woman's movement."</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, our Treasurer,
was to come forward to give yet one more proof
that Annie Kenney's words were true. When the
treasurer had imagined that Mrs. Pankhurst's chair
was to be an empty one, she had planned that those
present should place in it an offering of money for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the cause, but now she would be able to place that
offering in the founder's hands. Towards the sum
that was collected there was already the £2,382
11s. 7d, which had been raised by the devotion and
sacrifice of members of the Union during the week
of self denial; a promise of £1,000 a year till
women were enfranchised, from a lady who wished
to remain anonymous, and a second £1,000 which
Mrs. Lawrence herself, in conjunction with her husband,
wished to give. And now it was for the audience
to do their part.</p>

<p>Whilst the treasurer had been speaking, Mr. Lawrence
had been arranging a scoring apparatus.
Then, one by one, twelve women rose up in the hall
and each promised to give £100. Their example
was followed by numbers of others. At the same
time, promise cards, filled up by members of the audience,
were constantly being handed to the platform,
where Mrs. Lawrence read them out. At last the
sum of £7,000 had been set up, and, with a stirring
call from Christabel to work at the by-elections at
Peckham and Hastings in which the Union was
then engaging, the meeting closed.</p>

<p>As it was in London, the Peckham election was of
course most noticed by the Press and, because it was
so near its headquarters, the Women's Social and
Political Union was able to put up the biggest fight
there.</p>

<p>On Peckham Rye, a stretch of common land where
hosts of preachers and speakers of all kinds are to
be heard on every holiday, each of the parties in the
election, including the Suffragettes, began by holding
a meeting on the first Sunday of the contest.
There was a good deal of rather dangerous horseplay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which ominously recalled the Mid-Devon election,
the Suffragettes being chief target of the
disturbers. But before many days were over the situation
had entirely changed. Peckham, as every
Londoner knows, is one of that great forest of suburbs
of mushroom growth on the south side of the
river. Its miles and miles of dingy streets are lined
with monotonous rows of ugly little houses which the
jerry builder tries to convert into villa residences
by disfiguring with heavy over-ornamented stone
work and by planting a useless pillar on either side
of the narrow doorway. A large proportion of
these little dwellings are tenanted by at least two
families, and the district is given over to small shopkeepers
and clerks, shop assistants, teachers and those
who belong more frankly to the working classes.
No one who can afford to live elsewhere chooses
to live in Peckham; it is full of honest worthy people,
but there is nothing romantic or attractive about
it.</p>

<p>The Suffragettes opened their Committee Rooms
in the High Street and soon seemed to be everywhere.
They were riding up and down on the noisy
electric tram cars and dashing along Rye Lane,
where the cheap shops are and where on Saturday
nights you can buy everything for half the usual
price at the costermongers' stalls, chalking the pavements,
giving out handbills, and speaking at the street
corners, and soon it was found that these busy, active
women had not only converted almost everyone in the
district to the justice of their claims, but had captured
the heart of the constituency. How had it
happened? Partly, it may be, because of the romance
and colour that they had brought into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
humdrum Peckham life, but perhaps the following
impressions of "An Enthusiast" which appeared in
the <i>Daily Mail</i> in the midst of the election will best
explain the mystery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Three happy girls, eyes laughter-lit, breezy, buoyant, joyous,
arm in arm, talking like three cascades, are making a
royal progress down "the lane that leads to Rye." Such is
the head of the comet. Just a glance at the tail. A heterogeneous
nebula of human life&mdash;all ranks and ages, both
sexes and all professions, following, jostling, bustling, hustling.
Miss Christabel Pankhurst shakes herself free from
one of her supporters, and takes under her wing a barefoot,
ragged urchin, whose eyes are dancing with glee and pride,
for his pals are envious. Who is he that that gloved hand
should rest caressingly upon his shoulder? The girl and the
gamin trudge along together. "Oh, ain't she just sweet?"
says a factory girl, "and fancy 'er abeen to prison!"
"Carn't she tork&mdash;my word?" chimes in her mate.
"Why, she just shut up them blokes as arsked the questions
just like a man, she did!"</p>

<p>Her magnetism lies in her complexity, her bafflingness,
her buoyance, her radiant health, her colouring&mdash;that of the
inside of a seashell. She is so every inch alive&mdash;the very
exuberance of life, body and mind. Not the racked intensity
that comes of nerves high strung and over-active
brain, but just that finger-tip aliveness which comes of perfect
health and perfect happiness in engrossing occupation.</p>

<p>This girl orator and organiser, martyr and crusader, holds
and sways her crowds by a very network of antithesis, and
her rosy face is the index of her complexity. Defiance
chases demureness; she flings a madcap word and then lectures
you like a schoolmistress.</p>

<p>One moment reticent, grave, and serious, then simmering
with mischief, as she lays a Cabinet Minister or a man in
the crowd safely upon his back&mdash;O rash questioner! Then
her wilfulness&mdash;that puckered chin tells a tale&mdash;yet her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
willingness to listen and to learn. Her melting, comprehending
sympathy for the sorrowful and heavy-laden&mdash;her
rapier wit and repartee, but ever smothered in the white
sugar of good humour. All these you see&mdash;some, when
sitting in the background of the trolly, she seeks to hide
from the public stare, which she shrinks from with a maiden's
modesty when not actually engaged in speaking&mdash;others,
when with lissome figure swaying, in rhythmic sympathy
with the outpouring words, she fastens her mind and
yours upon the point at issue.</p>

<p>And then her unconscious petulance. That green veil of
hers tied under her chin that would for ever get awry.
Yes, she is very, very feminine, and that is what will win
the vote for women.</p>

<p>With a voice that never tires (nor ever tires the listener),
she is born to charm the ear with an ebb and flow of sweet
sound&mdash;sound so clear, so silver, so bell-like, now rising,
now falling, now rushing and tumultuous, now measured
and tempered and austere&mdash;earnest and grave&mdash;impetuous,
a very volley, ardent, burning, scathing, denunciatory&mdash;then
sinking to appeal to low notes and something near to
sadness.</p>

<p>Shall I speak of her logic? It is inexorable. It is not on
mere smart retort that she depends when heckled&mdash;she has
a good case and relies on it. She is saturated with facts,
and the hecklers find themselves heckled, twitted, tripped,
floored. I think they like it. She does, and shows it. She
flings herself into the fray, and literally pants for the next
question to tear to shreds. Her questioners are for the most
part earthenware, and this bit of porcelain does them in the
eye, quaintly, daintily, intellectually, glibly.</p>

<p>Look to it, Mr. Gautrey, or the witchery of Christabel
will "do you in the eye."</p>
</div>

<p>No, the electors of Peckham agreed, these Suffragettes
were not the sort of women they had read of.
They were neither the "disorderly," "shouting,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
"abusive," "unsexed," "violent" creatures, nor the
"soured," "dry," and "disappointed" women they
had been led to expect.</p>

<p>It was not merely the "enthusiast" in the <i>Daily
Mail</i> who testified to the work that the Suffragettes
were doing. Conservative newspapers, though they
generally preferred to ignore the Suffragettes because,
though opposing the Government, they were
not supporting either the Conservative candidates
or their proposals, nevertheless they allowed some of
the truths that the special correspondent told them
about the women's campaign to filter into their columns.</p>

<p>The <i>Standard</i> said: "These women are prepared
to kill themselves with fatigue and exposure,
not for the vote but for what the vote means." The
<i>By-Stander</i> said: "The ladies' tongues have been
tireless and their brains inexhaustible. Of all the
assembled bodies, and their name was legion, who
thronged Peckham, theirs has been the most persistent."
The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> said: "Everybody
seems agreed that the best speeches in the election
are being made by the lady Suffragists," whilst the
<i>Daily Mail</i> asserted that "in no contest have the
Suffragettes figured so largely or done such harm to
the Radical candidate."</p>

<p>There is a type of man who will sometimes ask a
woman's advice about politics and may even admit
that she is not only a better speaker than he is but
knows more about public questions than he will ever
know, and who yet thinks it quite tolerable that she
should be forever debarred from voting, though he
has had that privilege since he was twenty-one. Men
of this type are usually great followers of Party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and allow their ideas of right and wrong in politics
to be almost entirely dictated by the actions of the
very fallible gentlemen who happen to be their Party
leaders. Liberals of this type, whether editors of
newspapers, journalists, Members of Parliament, or
merely rank and file, had always condemned the
Suffragettes because the Liberal party happened to
be attacked by them.</p>

<p>The Suffragette opposition at Peckham caused
them to be more indignant than ever, for Peckham
was a Liberal seat that had been held at the last election
by the great majority of 2,339 votes, and if
this big majority were to be pulled down they feared
that the House of Lords would be emboldened to
throw out the Government's Licensing Bill which
was then being debated in Parliament. It was true
that, though the Liberals now spoke of this Bill as
being of paramount importance, they had themselves
been just as keen upon a host of other questions and
had over and over again before this called upon the
Suffragettes to stand aside and refrain from pressing
their claim at what on each occasion they assured
them was <i>the crisis</i> of all crises. First it had been
that the Liberal Government might come safely into
power that they had charged the women to wait,
then that Free Trade might be put out of danger,
then for the passage of the Education Bill, the Plural
Voting Bill and every measure put forward. In
every case they assumed that the proposal advanced
by the Liberal Cabinet was the only possible
solution of the problem and in spite of the differences
of opinion amongst men, they maintained that
no right-minded woman could conscientiously wish
for any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>When it came to the question of the Licensing Bill,
the Liberal politicians declared that the sole issue
of the election was between the Licensing Bill on the
one hand and intemperance on the other. This was
absurd, for if the Liberals wished to be rid of the
Suffragette opposition, they had only to remove their
veto from the Woman's Bill.</p>

<p>On the morning after their release from Holloway,
Mrs. Pankhurst and the other ex-prisoners
drove off to Peckham in brakes and paraded the constituency
holding meetings at various points, and
worked there incessantly until the end. A procession
of their own ex-prisoners was also organised by
the Suffragettes of the Women's Freedom League
who were also helping to fight the Government in
this election. The Liberals retorted by displaying
a big stocking, blue, the Peckham Liberals colour,
labelled, "since my wife turned Suffragette I can't
get my stockings darned!" but this fell very flat.
On polling day the <i>Star</i> showed its belief in the
strong influence which women were exerting in the
election, by making its final appeal on behalf of the
Government candidate, not to the men voters but to
the women of Peckham. The Suffragettes were stationed
at every polling booth, and, as the voters
passed in, many of those who had hitherto voted for
the Liberal party handed their colours and polling
cards to the women with a promise to vote against
the Government on this occasion. On seeing this
one of the Liberal officials became so angry that he
threatened to prosecute a member of the Freedom
League under the Corrupt Practices Act.</p>

<p>In the evening after the poll closed, Mrs. Drummond,
upon whom the organisation of the Suffragettes'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
campaign had chiefly fallen, and who had
been too busy all day even to get a meal, repaired
to the Town Hall where the votes were being
counted. As she stood waiting on the steps, weariness
showing at last in every line of her bonnie round
face and sturdy little figure, the door-keeper, invited
her to rest in the entrance hall until the result was
known. Presently she heard a loud burst of shouting,
and a number of men, in the midst of whom was
Mr. Winston Churchill, came running down the
stairs from the count. She started up, eager to learn
the news, but was swept out into the street in the
midst of those who were impetuously rushing on. At
that moment there flared out a magnesium light&mdash;red,
the Conservative colour. It was known that
the Government candidate had been defeated,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and
the huge crowd outside broke into cheers. Mr.
Churchill was pushed about like anyone else, and
had to work his way out of the throng, but the working
men seeing Mrs. Drummond there, a worker
like themselves, who had been labouring strenuously
amongst them during the past week, and whom they
all thoroughly respected, crowded round her cheering,
and as her husband's constituents did to little
Scotch Maggie in Mr. Barrie's play "What Every
Woman Knows," they lifted her shoulder-high, and
bore her in triumph down the street. But Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Drummond felt exceedingly uncomfortable in this
exalted state, and, asking to be released, hurriedly
sped away.</p>

<p>Now that their late majority of 2,339 had been
turned into a majority for the Conservatives of
2,494, the Liberals proceeded to heap abuse upon
the electors and to assert that the contest had been
disgraced by unprecedented corruption and insobriety.
But the experience of the Suffragettes was that the
election was one of the most sober and orderly that
they had ever attended, and their feeling was that
the defeat of the Liberal candidate was very much
more largely due to the Government's refusal to
grant votes to women and to its coercive treatment of
the women's movement than to any other cause.
This opinion was shared by many others. Dr. Robert
Esler, the Divisional Surgeon for Peckham,
wrote to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><i>Sir</i>:</p>

<p>The statement was advanced several times that the new
member was floated into the House on beer.... Lest
others should infer from the words that the electors constitute
a drunken community, may I, being in a position
to know the facts, indicate them.... During the ten
days of intense tension in canvassing and speaking, there was
literally no insobriety.... The charges at the police
station fell much below the usual low average, ...
and there was not a single assault case.... In my
opinion a high moral tone was imparted at the beginning by
the presence on the Rye of the ladies who took part in the
proceedings. Their dignified demeanour and cultured oratory
made a profound impression, and I think this should not
be overlooked when considering the result.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. St. John G. Ervine wrote to the Liberal organ,
<i>The Nation</i>, on March 28th, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is not a man in the National Liberal Club to-day
who does not know that Mid-Devon was lost to the
Liberals because of the adverse action of the militant
suffragists, a fact which was patent even to the rowdy mob
who rolled Mrs. Pankhurst in the mud when the result
of that poll was declared. There is not a Liberal member
to-day who does not dread the prospect of a General Election
with the absolute certainty that he will have to fight,
not only the usual enemy, but also a very determined body,
which, at the present time, has no political creed other than
that expressed in the three words "Votes for Women."
I am wrong, there is one man who does not seem to realise
all this, to whom Mid-Devon was not a warning, to whom
Peckham will convey no sign of further trouble, the
Premier elect, Mr. Asquith.... This Peckham election
has been a revelation to me of the perfectly wonderful
forces which the Women's Social and Political Union are
bringing to bear on by-elections.... As a purely impartial
observer of the Peckham election I submit to you,
Sir, and to the Liberal party, that it is time they started
doing something for the women. The mandate might not
have been there in 1906, but it most certainly is there now.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Gooch, the successful candidate, stated: "A
great feature of this election has been the activity of
the supporters of women's suffrage." And even the
<i>Daily News</i>, which published a correspondence from
its readers dealing with the Liberal defeat at Peckham,
stated in its issue of March 31st, that the majority
of the letters received referred to the action
taken by the Suffragettes.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>APRIL AND MAY, 1908</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Asquith Becomes Prime Minister. Defeat of
Mr. Winston Churchill in North West Manchester
and His Election at Dundee; Mr.
Asquith's Offer and the Women's Reply.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Owing to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's continued
illness, Mr. Asquith had been acting as his
deputy for many months past, and the Easter Holidays
were scarcely over when it was announced that
he had become Prime Minister in fact, for the state
of Sir Henry's health had compelled him to resign.
The Ex-Premier did not live long afterwards.
Though he had been converted to Women's Suffrage
late in life when his fighting powers were always
seriously impaired, there is little doubt that he spoke
truly when he declared his disappointment at not being
able to do anything for the Suffragists when they
waited upon him in deputation on the 19th of May,
1906; and, if ever the secret history of the Government
during that time comes to be written, we shall
probably learn that, had he possessed the strength
to enforce his will upon his colleagues, votes would
have been granted to women that very year. Once
when Annie Kenney and Mary Gawthorpe were travelling
with Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence to Bordighera,
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and they
chanced to enter the same train and afterwards Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Henry happened to seat himself at the very table
where Annie and Mary were taking tea. They at
once introduced themselves to him and all three had
a long talk together in the course of which Annie
naïvely assured him, "You have no one in the Cabinet
so clever as Miss Christabel Pankhurst." Other
things, too, she must have told him out of her loyal,
earnest heart for, as she explained to us later, "he
looked <i>so</i> much happier afterwards," and we have
been told by some who knew him that, when criticisms
of the Suffragettes were subsequently made in
his hearing, he would invariably protest, "Oh, you
must not say anything against my little friend, Annie
Kenney."</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith who had come to take his place, was
a man of very different metal. He was one whom
nobody seemed to like and the only reason for his
having become Prime Minister appeared to be that
he had the reputation of being what is <i>called</i> "a
strong man," and what generally turns out to <i>be</i> an
obstinate one. It was a significant fact that it was
whilst he had held the reins of power during Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman's illness, that the practice
of treating the Suffragettes as first class misdemeanants
had been abandoned. On the promotion
of Mr. Asquith, a general move up to better paid and
more important posts took place in the Cabinet.
According to the Constitutional Law of the country,
the newcomers into the Cabinet were obliged to vacate
their seats and to offer themselves for re-election.
At the same time there were three elevations from
the lower to the upper House, curtailing a choice of
new representatives in the Commons by the constituencies
for which the new peers had sat. Two vacancies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
also occurred owing to deaths, and Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman's own seat at Stirling Burghs
was soon vacant. Something almost like a miniature
General Election was therefore sprung upon the country,
and the Suffragettes were compelled to marshal
their forces simultaneously in no fewer than nine constituencies.</p>

<p>The election at North West Manchester, where a
vigorous campaign was organised in opposition to
Mr. Winston Churchill, who was endeavouring to
obtain the people's sanction to his appointment as
President of the Board of Trade, was the most
hardly fought, and aroused the greatest interest. It
was the scene of the first anti-Government struggle
during which Mr. Churchill had angrily declared
that he was being "henpecked"; but the women
had no need to go round to his meetings now, as they
had done then, in order to attract public attention to
their cause, for all Manchester was now wanting to
hear about it. The Suffragettes had but to arrange
their own meetings and the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> itself
was ready to publish a detailed list of them in its
columns.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill himself, Cabinet Minister though
he was to be, could not obtain such crowded audiences
as the Suffragettes.</p>

<p>At the same time many Liberal women, dissatisfied
with the behaviour of the Government and profoundly
distrustful of Mr. Asquith, held almost entirely
aloof from the contest while Miss Margaret
Ashton, one of the most prominent, publicly stated
that she would work no more for the Liberal Party
until the Liberal Party were prepared to give her a
vote. The <i>Manchester Guardian</i> wofully deplored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
these defections; declaring that "the Women's Liberal
Associations were deprived in a large measure of
their natural leaders" and tended "to become as
sheep without a shepherd," and Mr. Churchill now
began to realise that the women's opposition was a
serious matter. Therefore, asked at an election
meeting on April 15th, what he intended to do
to help women to obtain the Parliamentary franchise,
Mr. Churchill made the following statement: "I
will try my best as and when occasion offers, because
I do think sincerely that the women have always
had a logical case <i>and they have now got behind
them a great popular demand amongst women</i>. It
is no longer a movement of a few extravagant and
excitable people, but one which is gradually spreading
to all classes of women, and, that being so, <i>it
assumes the same character as franchise movements
have previously assumed</i>."</p>

<p>Some people thought that the Suffragettes would
be satisfied with Mr. Churchill's promise to use his
influence, and would accordingly withdraw their opposition
to his return, but Christabel Pankhurst at
once addressed a letter to the Manchester press explaining
that the W. S. P. U. would be satisfied
with nothing less than a definite understanding from
the Prime Minister, and the Government as a whole,
that the equal Women's Enfranchisement Bill would
be carried into law without delay.</p>

<p>When polling began at eight o'clock on the morning
of April 25th the Suffragettes took their places
at the entrance to the booths in the midst of a heavy
snow storm and remained there is spite of it, throughout
the day. The excitement which had been growing
as the contest progressed was not confined to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
poorer members of the electorate, but spread in all
its force to the candidates themselves, and one of the
Suffragettes was able to tell that when Mr. Churchill
drove past the polling booth at which she was stationed,
he stood up in his open carriage, shouting
and shaking his fist at her.</p>

<p>During the counting of the votes, huge crowds
assembled in Albert Square outside the Town Hall,
and inside there was a large gathering of the more
favoured persons. With pallid face the future Cabinet
Minister walked feverishly up and down the
room and when the figures were announced and it
was known that Mr. Joynson-Hicks had defeated
him by a majority of 429 votes, the Suffragettes, although
they were his opponents, could not refrain
from pitying him, for he burst into tears and hid
his face on his mother's breast. As he passed out
of the room, Mrs. Drummond, always eager and
impulsive, darted up to him and, laying her hand
on his arm, said: "It is the women that have done
this, Mr. Churchill. You will understand now that
we must have our vote." But he shook her off petulantly
saying, "Get away, woman!" Meanwhile,
Mr. Joynson-Hicks was outside thanking the electors
who had returned him to Parliament, and in the
course of his remarks he said: "I acknowledge the
assistance I have received from those ladies who are
sometimes laughed at, but who, I think, will now be
feared by Mr. Churchill,&mdash;the Suffragists." These
words were received with cheers. Next day all the
newspapers were discussing Mr. Churchill's defeat
and amongst others, the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> (L),
the <i>Daily News</i> (L), the <i>Morning Leader</i> (L), the
<i>Daily Mirror</i> (C), the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (C), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<i>Daily Chronicle</i> (L), and the <i>Standard</i> (C), admitted
that this was largely due to the opposition of
the Suffragettes, whilst the <i>Daily News</i> now called
upon the Liberal Party to bring this state of affairs to
an end by granting the suffrage to women.</p>

<p>Of course it was a foregone conclusion that a safe
seat would now be found for Mr. Churchill, and
that of Dundee, which happened to be vacant, was
immediately offered to him. On his accepting the
invitation, the Suffragettes' armies hastened North
to oppose him, and Mrs. Pankhurst held a great
meeting in the Kinnaird Hall on the evening before
his arrival. One of Mr. Churchill's first acts on
reaching the constituency was to address a gathering
of Liberal women, for he was determined to make
every effort to secure their help in counteracting the
influence of the Suffragettes. Instead of expatiating
on the greatness of the general principles of his
party, and calling upon his hearers to support him
on those grounds, as politicians had been wont to do
in the past, he dealt almost entirely with votes for
women, saying that there was a "general demand"
for the suffrage on the part of "a very large body
of women throughout the country," and that the
question had "now come into the arena of practical
politics." He asked to be considered as a
friend of the movement, and added, "No one can
be blind to the fact that at the next General Election,
Women's Suffrage will be a real <i>practical issue
and the next Parliament, I think, ought to see the
gratification of the women's claims. I do not exclude
the possibility of the suffrage being dealt with
in this Parliament.</i>" He refused, however, to give
any pledge that those in power would take action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
He went on to describe the Suffragettes, as "hornets,"
and presumably referring to the by-election at Peckham,
he said: "I have seen with regret, some of
the most earnest advocates of the cause allying themselves
with the forces of drink and reaction carried
shoulder high, so I am informed, by the rowdy elements
which are always to be found at the tail of a
public-house made agitation."</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill's slanderous innuendoes in regard
to the Women's Campaign at Peckham were not
considered worthy of notice by the W. S. P. U., but
Miss Maloney, a high spirited young member of the
Women's Freedom League who had also taken part
in that particular by-election, determined that she
would force him to withdraw what he had said. At
his next open air meeting she appeared brandishing
a large muffin bell and warned him that unless he
would apologise to the women, she would not let him
speak. As he refused to do so, she carried out her
threat. The Women's Social and Political Union
regretted this action, because at by-elections they preferred
to fight the Government with argument alone,
but the Freedom League upheld Miss Maloney, and
she continued to make it impossible for Mr. Churchill
to speak in the open. On the eve of the poll it
came to a pitched battle between them in which Miss
Maloney triumphed. It had been arranged that
Mr. Churchill should address a meeting at the Gas
Works and "la Belle Maloney," as she was afterwards
nicknamed, was speaking at the gates when he
appeared. As before she at once called upon him
to apologise, but, without answering, he passed on
to enter the gates. She followed and though Mr.
Churchill's friends strove to prevent her entering, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
crowd swept her into the yard. She had lost her
bell in the rush but, quite undaunted, she darted into
the shed where the meeting was to take place, and,
whilst Mr. Churchill mounted a bench to address
the workmen, Miss Maloney climbed up on to a
pile of boxes directly opposite to him. Again she
called for the apology, but he remained silent and
the crowd burst into shouts and yells. At last, as
the noise grew, the Manager of the Gas Works, a
supporter of the Government, shouted out, "hands
up all those who want to hear Mr. Churchill." A
few hands, half a dozen or so, were all that were
raised, and seeing this Miss Maloney cried, "Now,
friends, who wants to hear me?" and when a great
forest of hands shot up, in answer, she pressed home
her advantage saying, "Gentlemen, the resolution
has been put to the meeting and by a large majority
it has been decided in my favour." Then she went
on to explain what she had come for, but in the
midst of her words, Mr. Churchill jumped up and
repeated his earlier statement in a modified form.
For some time she and the future Cabinet Minister
continued shouting at each other through the uproar
of the crowd. At last, white with rage, he turned
tail and left the meeting to her. Thus, as the papers
said, "the amazing episode concluded."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Women's Social and Political
Union had been holding some two hundred large
and enthusiastic meetings in the constituency each
week, and on the eve of the poll they wound up with
five monster demonstrations, four of which were in
the open air and the fifth in the Drill Hall. Though
the bulk of the Press throughout the country preferred
to give greater space to the account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
incident between Mr. Churchill and Miss Maloney
with her bell, glowing accounts of these W. S. P. U.
meetings appeared in the Dundee papers. The
<i>Referee</i> for May 3rd also said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women are doing wonderful election work and not
getting half the credit for it that they deserve. Our wayward
Winnie does not underestimate them as a fighting
force. The War Song of the conquering Christabel to the
worsted Churchill is "Bonnie Dundee."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i0">"And Tremble, false Whig, in the midst of your glee,</div>
<div class="verse i0">You have not seen the last of my bonnet and me."</div>
</div></div></div>
</div>

<p>It was perhaps to guard against any falling off
in the Liberal Majority that on May 7th, two days
before the Dundee poll, Mr. Asquith announced in
the House of Commons that the establishment of
Old Age Pensions was to be the outstanding feature
of the forthcoming Budget. On polling day, May
9th, Liberal men and women stood beside the Suffragettes
at the polling booths with handbills which were
adapted from those of the Suffragettes, and read
"Vote for Churchill, and never mind the women,"
and "Put Churchill in and keep the Women out."</p>

<p>As had been a foregone conclusion, Mr. Churchill
was returned by a large majority, but he received
more than 2,000 votes fewer than Mr. Robertson,
his predecessor, had done at the last election, and,
whilst fifty-eight per cent. of the recorded votes
had been cast for Mr. Robertson, Mr. Churchill only
received forty-four per cent. of the total, and therefore
represented a minority of the electors.</p>

<p>In the batch of by-elections which had occurred
since Mr. Asquith had become Prime Minister, most
of them as a consequence of the change in the ministerial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
leadership, the Government had therefore
suffered a reduction of 6,663 votes or more than
eighteen per cent. of the total Liberal poll recorded
in the same constituencies at the General Election of
1906. Though the party leaders denied that the
Suffragette campaign had affected any of the election
results, there were few who had really worked in the
elections who believed this and only Cabinet Ministers,
newspaper editors and the Suffragettes themselves
could form any impression of the large number
of influential people who were writing to one or
other of those three agencies to say so. At the
same time a growing spirit of disaffection towards
the Government was showing itself amongst Liberal
women and Miss Florence Balgarnie's declaration
that they had been "hewers of wood and the
drawers of water for the Liberal Party too long, and
that they must now look out for themselves," found
a wide echo.</p>

<p>An ominous resolution had now been set down
on the agenda for the Women's Liberal Federation
Conference on behalf of the Cuckfield Association
which stated that "Unless Women's Suffrage is
granted before the dissolution of Parliament, the
time will have arrived for a definite refusal on the
part of Liberal women to work at Parliamentary
elections." These things, doubtless, led Mr. Asquith
to receive on May 20th, a deputation of Liberal
Members of Parliament who urged him to grant
the few days required for the carrying into law of
Mr. Stanger's Women's Enfranchisement Bill, which
earlier in the Session had already passed its second
reading by so large a majority. In reply Mr. Asquith
said that he himself did not wish to see women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
enfranchised, and that it was impossible for the
Government to give any time for Mr. Stanger's Bill,
but he added, "barring accidents, I regard it as a
duty, indeed a binding obligation on this Government,
before the present Parliament comes to an end,
to bring in a really effective scheme for the reform
of our electoral system." Having referred to what
he considered to be the defects in the existing electoral
provisions, dwelling especially on that of plural
voting, he explained that, though the Government
intended to introduce a Reform Bill, Woman's
Suffrage was to have no place in it, but that when
the Bill had been laid before the House, those Members
of Parliament who believed in giving Votes
to Women might move an amendment to that effect.
If this were done, he did not consider it would be any
of the Government's duty to oppose such an amendment,
because two-thirds of the Cabinet were of the
opinion that women should vote. But though Mr.
Asquith began by stating that the Government would
not oppose the amendment if it were approved by
the House of Commons, he went on to attach certain
conditions to this promise. These were, that
any proposed Women's Suffrage amendment "must
be on democratic lines," and "it must clearly have
behind it the support&mdash;the strong and undoubted
support&mdash;of the women of the country as well as of
the present electorate."</p>

<p>Christabel Pankhurst at once exposed the unsatisfactory
nature of Mr. Asquith's statement through
the medium of the Press. She pointed out that he
had not shown sufficient reason for his refusal to give
facilities for the discussion of the Women's Enfranchisement
Bill, and recalled the fact that after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
second reading of the Women's Bill had been carried,
a London Electoral Reform Bill had been introduced
by a private Member, and that the Government
had promised to carry this latter Bill into law,
if it should pass the second reading. The House
had, however, rejected the London Electoral Bill,
and the time which the Government had designed to
give that measure might therefore be handed over to
the Votes for Women Bill. In regard to the details
of Mr. Asquith's promise, she explained that
women could not wait contentedly for the introduction
of the proposed Reform Bill, because, as Mr.
Asquith had himself foreshadowed, in his words
"barring accidents," some unforeseen turn of events
might precipitate a General Election before it had
been introduced. Even if the Reform Bill were actually
laid before Parliament the position of the
Government with regard to Women's Enfranchisement
was far from satisfactory. Apart from the
fact that their refusal to make this question a part
of the original Reform Bill was certainly insulting
to women, the promise not to oppose an amendment
moved by a private Member and carried by the
House of Commons could not be relied on, because
two conditions had been attached to it. The first
condition was that it should be framed on "democratic
lines." But Mr. Asquith had not defined the
term "democratic" and there was reason to fear
that the Government intended to resist the proposal
to enfranchise women on the terms applying to men
voters to which a majority of the House of Commons
had pledged itself. Mr. Asquith was an anti-Suffragist,
and, according to the vague form of his statement,
it was open to him to object to any and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
amendment except one that was of so broad a nature
that it could scarcely pass the House of Commons
and would certainly be thrown out by the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>The second condition was that the women of the
country and the present electorate should show their
strong and undoubted desire for a measure of
women's enfranchisement, but Mr. Asquith had neglected
to indicate how this desire should be expressed.
The Women's Social and Political Union contended
that the women had already, by demonstrating, petitioning,
and going to prison for their cause, shown
a very strong and very earnest desire for the franchise,
and that the electors in the by-elections had
also shown their belief in the justice of Votes for
Women. But Mr. Asquith had hitherto refused to
admit that such a desire had been manifested, and it
was possible that he would always refuse to recognise
its existence. Even if, in spite of all obstacles,
the Woman's Suffrage amendment were safely carried
and secured a place in the Reform Bill, the Bill
itself was certain to prove a highly controversial
measure. It was to deal with many other electoral
questions besides that of Women's Suffrage, and if,
as was only too probable, it were shipwrecked upon
one of these, the Woman's claim to vote would go
down with the rest.</p>

<p>The opinion of Christabel Pankhurst and that of
the other leaders of the Women's Social and Political
Union appeared in the Press next morning and
in the Conservative papers there were other warnings;
the <i>Standard</i> plainly said, "Of course Mr.
Asquith does not intend to carry such a change."
But most of the Liberal papers upheld Mr. Asquith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The <i>Daily News</i> called for a cessation of the militant
tactics of the Suffragettes and referring to Christabel's
objections said, "A more mature and experienced
leader than Miss Christabel Pankhurst would
have understood that the pledge which Mr. Asquith
has given is quite exceptionally definite and binding."
The <i>Star</i> said, "The meaning of Mr. Asquith's
pledge is plain: Women's Suffrage will be
passed through the House of Commons before the
present Government goes to the country."</p>

</div>

<p>Events have already proved how rightly Christabel
and the other Suffragette leaders had summed up
the situation, for two General Elections have since
come and gone and still women remain unenfranchised
and the promised Reform Bill has not yet been
introduced. But at the time only too many women
were deceived by Mr. Asquith's false promise.
Lady Carlisle presided over the Liberal Women's
Conference which met next morning. "This is a
glorious day of rejoicing," she cried. "Our great
Prime Minister, all honour to him, has opened a way
to us by which we can enter into that inheritance
from which we have been too long debarred." She
swept the majority of the women onward with her.
A resolution of deepest gratitude to Mr. Asquith and
the Cabinet was carried with every sign of enthusiastic
joy, and the Cuckfield resolution was lost by
an overwhelming majority.</p>

<p>Whilst the Liberal women were thus thanking the
Prime Minister for his worthless "pledge," another
body of women were striving to expose his insincerity,
for, before ten o'clock that morning, the members
of the Women's Freedom League were at the
door of number ten Downing Street armed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
petition asking for an assurance either that the Government
would give facilities for the passing of a
Women's Suffrage measure or would promise to include
Women's Suffrage in a general Government
Reform Bill to be introduced before the end of the
Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith refused to give an answer and sent
out police to clear the women away. Eventually
they were arrested and sent to prison for from seven
to twenty-one days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Stirling Burghs, the last of the recent
series of by-elections, the Liberals were using
Mr. Asquith's false promise to counteract the influence
of the Suffragettes. The Women's Freedom
League had wasted no time in making their protest
to expose it and the Women's Social and Political
Union had also proclaimed it to be worthless, but
polling was already taking place, and on every newspaper
placard appeared the words: "Premier's
great Reform Bill, Votes for Women," and there
was no time for the Suffragettes to undeceive the
people.</p>

<p>When the result of the poll was declared, it was
found that the Liberal majority of 630, that had been
cast for the late Prime Minister in the General Election,
had been more than doubled. The actual
Liberal poll had also increased from 2,715 to 3,873.
Thus the constant falling off in the Liberal vote
which had manifested itself through so many elections
was suddenly checked.</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith's promise had done its work at the
Stirling by-election and had secured the loyalty of
the Liberal Women for another year.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, May 27th, just a week after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
day on which it had been given to the deputation of
Liberal members who supported Woman's Suffrage,
Mr. Asquith was questioned in the House of Commons
by Mr. Alfred Hutton, a Liberal Member,
who was opposed to it. Mr. Hutton asked whether
he considered himself pledged to introduce the proposed
Reform Bill during the present Parliament,
whether in that event he would give an opportunity
for raising the question of Woman's Suffrage, and
whether, if a Woman's Suffrage amendment to the
Government Reform Bill were carried, it would
then become part of the Government policy in relation
to the franchise. After some close cross-questioning,
in which he had tried hard to evade the
point, Mr. Asquith finally replied, "My Honourable
Friend has asked me a contingent question with regard
to a remote and speculative future." Thus
was the hollowness of the vaunted pledge exposed.</p>

<p>The Liberal papers still called upon the women
to support the Cabinet, but in spite of this they
showed that they found it difficult to uphold the
trickery of their leader, and it was the Liberal <i>Daily
Chronicle</i> that said "the skill and dexterity of the
Prime Minister in parrying embarrassing questions
was much admired, but not a few loyal supporters
of the Government felt that the occasion was one
that demanded candour rather than adroitness."</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>JUNE, 1908</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">How Mr. Gladstone's Challenge Was Accepted.
The Procession of 13,000 Suffragists on June 13th.
The Great Hyde Park Demonstration on the
Twenty-first of June, and the Demonstration of
Protest in Parliament Square on June 30th.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>The time was now approaching when the women
were to take up Mr. Gladstone's challenge to them
to show that they could rival the great franchise
demonstrations which men had held in demanding
the three Reform Acts of 1832, 1867 and 1885.
In the Autumn of 1907, long before the challenge
had been made, the Women's Social and Political
Union had determined to hold a record meeting in
Hyde Park on Sunday, June 21st, 1908. The
greatest meeting that had ever yet been held there
was said to have numbered 72,000, but it was determined
that at the Women's demonstration there
must be gathered at least a quarter of a million people.
The organisation of this great project was the
work of many months and a large part of this fell
to the share of our devoted Treasurer, Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence, her husband, and Mrs. Drummond who
now began to be called our "general." Mr. Lawrence
carefully thought out the scheme for the seven
great processions which were to march into Hyde
Park by seven separate gates. To Mrs. Pethick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Lawrence was primarily due the introduction of the
colours, purple, white and green, which the Union
now adopted for its own. The colours at once secured
a most amazing popular success for, although
they were not even thought of until the middle of
May, before the month of June arrived they were
known throughout the length and breadth of the
land.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As Treasurer of the Union, Mrs. Lawrence bore
upon her shoulders the special responsibility of meeting
the very heavy cost of the demonstration as
well as the other great expenses which were now being
incurred; but that magnetic power of hers which
had hitherto proved so invaluable to the movement
was as infallible as ever. Whatever the sum she
asked, it was immediately paid down. To make the
forthcoming demonstrations known to everyone an
immense poster, measuring thirteen feet by ten feet,
containing the photographs of the twenty women
who were to preside at the twenty platforms from
which the audience was to be addressed, as well as a
map showing the route of each of the seven processions
and a plan of the meeting place in Hyde Park
was displayed upon the hoardings in London and all
the principal provincial towns at a cost to the Union
of more than £1,000. Our organisers stationed in
various parts of the country arranged for thirty special
trains to run from seventy different towns in
order to carry contingents of women demonstrators
from the various provincial centres. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
time London itself was systematically organised for
the demonstration. My experiences as organiser of
the Chelsea district which included also Fulham and
Wandsworth, are vividly present with me as I write.
At many of the open air pitches from which we then
spoke, no Women's Suffrage meetings had ever been
held before, but wherever we went our experiences
were, in their main essentials, always the same. Our
first meeting was, usually, almost wholly a fight to
subdue a continued uproar. On more than one occasion
the little box or the chair used as a platform
was overturned by a gang of hooligan youths, and
the meeting had to be abandoned. But, whatever
may have happened at the first meeting in a fresh
place, we always found that at the second meeting
the majority of the audience were sympathetic. At
the third meeting all was harmony, and we were
generally seen to our homeward trams or busses by
cheering crowds.</p>

<p>Those splendid people, the Suffragettes of Kensington,
not only contrived to carry on a constant
campaign of meetings but at the same time to make
all their own banners and bannerettes.</p>

<p>In the meantime the National Union of Women's
Suffrage Societies, in conjunction with a number of
other organisations, had decided to organise a
women's procession, and on June 13th, a week and
a day before the Hyde Park demonstration, some
13,000 Suffragists assembled on the Embankment
and marched to the Albert Hall where a meeting
was held. It was a striking pageant with its many
gorgeous banners, richly embroidered and fashioned
of velvets, silks and every kind of beautiful material
and the small bannerettes showing as innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
patches of brilliant and lovely colour, each one varying
both in shape and hue. Seventy of the large banners
had been prepared by the Artists League for
Women's Suffrage. Some were blazoned with the figures
of women great in history, amongst them, Boadicea,
Joan of Arc and Queen Elizabeth; others
bore emblems commemorating women's heroic deeds,
or reforming achievements,&mdash;Elizabeth Fry, Lydia
Becker, and Mary Wollstonecraft, being amongst
those recalled. Walking in the procession were many
of Lydia Becker's comrades and contemporaries, including
the aged Miss Emily Davies, Dr. Garrett Anderson,
and her sister, Mrs. Fawcett, the President of
the National Union of Suffrage Societies. After
these came a contingent of international Suffragists;
Australians, Americans with their Stars and Stripes
headed by Dr. Anna Shaw, and representatives from
Hungary, Russia, South Africa, and other countries,
each with their national flags and colours. The professional
women were led by Mrs. Ayrton and other
scientists and a great band of medical women in their
splendid robes of crimson and black, with hoods of
purple, red and blue. Other graduates followed and
the representatives of Newnham and Girton were in
great force. Amongst the women writers, headed
by the Scrivener's banner, were Beatrice Harraden,
Elizabeth Robins and Evelyn Sharpe. Then came
the artists, the actresses. Next, the nurses, all in
uniform, and, after these, a host of others, gardeners,
pharmacists, physical trainers, typists and shorthand
writers, shop assistants, factory workers, and
home-makers. Next came the militant Women's
Freedom League, the Women's Co-operative Guild,
the National Union of Women Workers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
members of various women's organisations connected
with the political parties including the Women's
Liberal Associations, and the women of the Independent
Labour Party and the Fabian Society. Altogether
the procession was acknowledged to be the
most picturesque and effective political pageant that
had ever been seen in this country, and every newspaper
spoke of its impressive dignity and beauty.</p>

<p>Now the Women's Social and Political Union and
all whom they could press into the service were busily
engaged on a ten days' crusade for the winding up of
the Hyde Park Demonstration campaign. How the
women worked! They held innumerable meetings;
they went out canvassing from door to door; they
stood in the streets with flags and posters; they distributed
handbills broadcast; chalked announcements
upon the pavements and met the workmen's trains to
give out little purple, white and green mock railway
tickets, a million of which had been printed. On the
Thursday evening before the Demonstration, Mrs.
Drummond and a dozen other members of the Union
set sail for the Houses of Parliament in a steam
launch decorated with banners and posters announcing
the Demonstration. At the little tables on the
terrace many members, including Mr. Lloyd George,
were entertaining their lady friends at afternoon tea,
when the sound of a band playing heralded the Suffragettes'
arrival. Everyone crowded to the water's
edge as the boat stopped, and Mrs. Drummond began
to speak. She invited all Members of Parliament,
and especially Cabinet Ministers, to join the
women's procession to Hyde Park on the twenty-first
of June, assuring them that it was their duty to inform
themselves as to the feelings of the people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>She twitted the Government who were supposed to
be democratic with remaining always behind barred
gates under the protection of the police, and urged,
"Come to the Park on Sunday; you shall have police
protection there also, and we promise you that there
shall be no arrests." The Members appeared both
pleased and interested and many more came flocking
out to listen, but somebody, a waiter it was said, hurriedly
telephoned to the police and in a few moments
Inspector Scantlebury with a number of officers appeared
on the Terrace, whilst at the same time one of
the police boats hove in sight. Seeing this, the Suffragettes
steamed away.</p>

<div id="Illus07" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="600" height="353" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Head of the Procession to Hyde Park, June 21st, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>On Sunday, the 21st, we were busy early in the
morning for the processions were to start between one
and two; the people were expected to begin to assemble
at least a couple of hours before that time. All
London seemed to have turned out to see us, and all
along the Chelsea Embankment, which was thronged
with people, were coffee stands, costermongers, and
hawkers selling badges and programmes in the purple,
white and green. When the moment for starting
came our Chelsea procession numbered some seven
thousand people, but the dense crowds of by-standers
marched with us too, and grew in a countless number
as we moved along, so that, instead of one procession
we had formed three&mdash;the central one being composed
almost entirely of women, wearing white dresses and
scarfs of purple, white and green, and carrying banners
in the same colours. The whole road was filled
with people moving with us, and from balconies, windows
and tops of busses people cheered and waved.
The same thing was happening in each of the other
six districts. At the head of each procession rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
policemen on horseback and numbers of constables
walked on either side of the ranks in order to keep
the way clear. Six thousand police in all accompanied
the seven processions, the police authorities
being most helpful and courteous toward us throughout
the arrangements.</p>

<p>In Hyde Park the railings for over a quarter of a
square mile had been taken up for us in order to add
a further open space to that which is usually open in
the neighbourhood of the Reformer's Tree. In the
centre of this meeting-ground a furniture van was
stationed to serve as an impromptu Conning Tower.
Those who stood there watching saw, first the fine
procession from Marylebone with great crowds
marching in on either side sweep into the quiet grassy
space, and then, one after another, from the seven
different gates, the rest of the seven processions with
their accompanying armies come streaming in. Before
we arrived from Chelsea the whole ground was
a surging mass of people, and it was with difficulty
that we made our way to the platform which had
been reserved for us. Once we gained it we clambered
hastily on to our lorry and looked around with
wondering and astonished gaze. As far as the eye
could reach was one vast mass of human beings&mdash;not
black, as crowds usually are,&mdash;but coloured, like
a great bed of flowers because of the thousands and
thousands of women all dressed in the lightest and
daintiest of summer garments, whilst even the men
had most of them come out in cool greys and were
wearing straw hats. Over the whole of the area
there was to be seen not a single blade of grass.
Who could attempt to estimate the number of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that were present? They were innumerable;
they defied calculation and there was no one of us
who had ever imagined that we should see so many
people gathered together. The sky was a perfect
blue; the sun poured down on us; everyone seemed
to be in holiday mood, just as they were in holiday
dress, and during the time in which the people
waited for the speakers to begin, perfect good humour
reigned. Then bugles were sounded from the
Conning Tower and the speeches at each of the
twenty platforms began.</p>

<div id="Illus08" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A Section of the great "Votes for Women" meeting in Hyde Park on June 21st, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>Probably less than half the people could hear the
speakers, but that was of small account. They had
come there to show their sympathy with Votes for
Women and to take part in the greatest demonstration
the world had ever seen, and if they stood there
the whole of the afternoon without catching a single
sentence, they had been well rewarded. At most of
the platforms there was nothing but the kindliest
sympathy, except at the platforms of Mrs. Pankhurst
and Christabel, where a number of rowdy and
ignorant young men attempted to prevent the speakers
from being heard.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the bugle sounded and the Resolution
calling upon the Government to give votes to
women without delay was put and carried at every
platform, in most cases without dissent. Then the
bugle was heard again and the cry, "One, two,
three!" and the assembled multitude, as they had
been asked to do, shouted, "Votes for Women!"
three times, and then that great and wonderful gathering
began slowly to disperse.</p>

<p>Next morning every newspaper devoted long columns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to the demonstration. In the course of a long
descriptive account the Special Correspondent of the
<i>Times</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Its organisers had counted on an audience of 250,000.
That expectation was certainly fulfilled and probably it
was doubled, and it would be difficult to contradict anyone
who asserted that it was trebled. Like the distances and
numbers of the stars, the facts were beyond the threshold of
perception.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Standard</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>From first to last, it was a great meeting, daringly conceived,
splendidly stage-managed, and successfully carried
out. Hyde park has probably never seen a greater crowd of
people.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is no combination of words which will convey an
adequate idea of the immensity of the crowd around the
platforms.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Daily Express</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Women Suffragists provided London yesterday with
one of the most wonderful and astonishing sights that have
ever been seen since the days of Boadicea.... It is
probable that so many people never before stood in one
square mass anywhere in England. Men who saw the
great Gladstone meeting years ago said that compared with
yesterday's multitude it was as nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Never, on the admission of the most experienced observers,
has so vast a throng gathered in London to witness an outlay
of political force.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>After the great meeting was over, its organisers
returned to Clement's Inn and Christabel Pankhurst
immediately wrote to the Prime Minister forwarding
the Resolution: "That this meeting calls upon the
Government to grant votes to women without delay,"
which had just been carried by that great gathering.
At the same time she asked "what action
the Government would take in response to the demand."</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith replied that he had nothing to add
to the statement&mdash;the so-called promise of a Reform
Bill, which he had made to the deputation of
Members of Parliament on May 20th.</p>

<p>The wonderful Hyde Park Demonstration, the
greatest meeting that had ever been held, and the
impressive procession of the Women's Societies both
of which had been held within a few days' space had
therefore, it seemed, made no impression upon the
Government. Seeing, therefore, that to argue further
would be mere waste of time, the Women's Social
and Political Union immediately decided to take
action. Hitherto, through all the hard battles which
the Suffragettes had fought outside the House of
Commons, they had never asked the general public
to come to their aid, but, now that the great peoples'
demonstration in Hyde Park had been thus contemptuously
ignored, it was decided to call upon
both men and women to attend another monster
meeting on June 30th, to be held this time in Parliament
Square, in order that the Government could
not fail to see.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Police replied by issuing a
warning to the public not to meet in Parliament
Square, on the ground that danger would necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
arise from the assembling of a large number of persons
in that restricted area, through which the way
must be kept for Members of Parliament.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the W. S. P. U. again and again
urged Mr. Asquith to receive a deputation, but he
still refused, and at last he was informed that the
deputation would start from the Women's Parliament
on June 30th, and would wait upon him at the
House of Commons at half past four that afternoon.
Once more he returned a refusal to see the women,
but Mrs. Pankhurst herself replied, as their leader,
that the deputation would arrive at the appointed
hour. Next day Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence and eleven other women set out from the
Caxton Hall. At the main entrance of the building
Superintendent Wells was waiting with a body of
some twenty constables and, at his orders, as soon as
the thirteen women had emerged, the doors were
locked and even the Pressmen begged in vain to be
released. Then the Superintendent constituted himself
the leader and protector of the deputation and
led them quickly through the cheering crowds who
pressed forward pushing and struggling to catch a
glimpse of the little band of women. Straight up
Victoria Street he led them and right to the door of
the Stranger's Entrance where they were met by the
burly and familiar form of Inspector Scantlebury
surrounded by his minions. He stepped forward and
addressed Mrs. Pankhurst gravely, "Are you Mrs.
Pankhurst, and is this your deputation?" he asked.
She answered, "Yes," and he said, "I have orders
to exclude you from the House of Commons."
"Has Mr. Asquith received my letter?" she questioned
him in turn, and, replying, "Yes," the Inspector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
drew the document from his pocket, adding
in response to a further inquiry, that Mr. Asquith
had sent no message of any kind by way of reply.
Then Inspector Scantlebury turned away and walked
into the House, leaving behind him a strong force of
police to guard the door. For an instant or two the
women stood there baffled, but they had to remember
the resolve that this effort to interview the Prime
Minister should be entirely peaceful. Moreover,
there was the Mass Meeting of the evening. They
therefore merely turned and made their way back
to the Caxton Hall. Meanwhile larger and larger
crowds were flocking towards Parliament from every
direction, and long before eight o'clock, the time at
which they had been asked to assemble, it was estimated
by the newspapers that more than 100,000
people had collected in Parliament Square. The police
had made most extensive preparations to prevent
any meeting being held and it was said that more
than 5,000 ordinary constables and upwards of fifty
mounted men had been requisitioned for this purpose.</p>

<p>When, at eight o'clock, the women sallied forth
in groups from the Caxton Hall to speak to the
great multitude that had assembled in response to
their appeal, the scene was already becoming turbulent.
There were no platforms to speak from, and
it would have been useless to provide them, for the
police would instantly have dragged them from the
ground. But it is possible to hold a meeting without
official sanction and to make speeches without platforms
and the women bravely essayed the task.
Some of them clung to the railings of Palace Yard
to raise themselves above the crowd, others mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the steps of the offices in Broad Sanctuary, others
the steps of the Government buildings at the top of
Parliament Street opposite the Abbey, whilst others
again merely spoke from the pavement wherever and
whenever the police would cease for an instant from
driving them along. Every woman who attempted
to speak was torn by the harrying constables from
the spot where she had found a foothold and was
either hurled aside and flung into the dense masses
that were being kept constantly on the move or
placed under arrest. Meanwhile, the crowd was always
surging and swaying forward shouting out
mingled cheers and jeers.</p>

<p>Some groups of the men stood with linked arms
around the women who were striving to make
speeches, bodies of others pushed little bands of Suffragettes
forward against the rows of constables with
cries of "Votes of Women," "we'll get you to the
House of Commons," and "back up the women and
push them through!" Again and again the police
lines were broken and again and again the mounted
men charged and beat the people back. Mr. Lloyd
George, Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. Herbert Gladstone,
Lord Rosebery and other members of both
Houses stood in Palace Yard, and near the Strangers'
entrance watching the scene. As it became dark the
disorder grew, and gangs of roughs who supported
neither the Government nor the women kept making
concerted rushes, sweeping the rest of the people on
before them, absolutely heedless of trampling others
under foot. In some cases isolated women were surrounded
by them and with difficulty rescued from
their ill treatment by the soberer and more respectable
members of the gathering. But, undaunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
either by violence from the roughs or from the police,
the Suffragettes, though their slight frames were
bruised and almost worn out by the constant battering
of those who were so much heavier, stronger and
more numerous than themselves, still continued to
address the throng. Every woman who was arrested
was followed to the police station by a stream
of cheering people and was saluted with raised hats
and waving handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>As Mr. Asquith passed from the House of
Commons to Downing Street in his motor-car he was
hooted by the crowd. He arrived home to find his
windows broken, for Mrs. Leigh and Mrs. New had
driven swiftly past the guardian policemen at the
entrance to the street in a taxicab and had each
thrown two small stones through two of the lower
windows of Number 10 before an arm of the Law
had been stretched out to drag them away to Canon
Row. Meanwhile Miss Mary Phillips had endeavoured
to dash into the House of Commons by way
of Palace Yard in the midst of a little company of
Parliamentary waitresses but half way across the
Yard had been seized and dragged back. Miss
Lena Lambert had chartered a little rowing boat
and had set off in the darkness to reach the House
from the river side. Crowds of Members were
lounging on the lighted terrace that hot summer's
night when she and her little craft appeared out of
the darkness, to urge them to determine that the simple
measure of justice, which was being so hardly
fought for, should be carried into law. But not
many words had she spoken, when the police boats
swooped down on her and she was towed away, lest
she should irritate and annoy the people's representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
by telling them of the battle whose dull roar
nothing could shut out.</p>

<p>So the night wore on and that weary fight continued.
Not until twelve o'clock did the police at
last succeed in clearing the streets, and it was then
found that twenty-nine women had been arrested.</p>

<p>Next morning twenty-seven of the women were
brought up at Westminster Police Court before the
Magistrate, Mr. Francis, and were charged with
obstructing the police in the execution of their duty.
With the usual callous haste their trial was hurried
through. The magistrate had always had all
the political rights that he cared to use and would not
trouble to imagine what it is like to be without them.
He testily brushed aside the defence of the women
that the Government had driven them to adopt these
methods of obtaining the franchise and that Mr.
Asquith by his ignoring of the Great Hyde Park
Demonstration had taught them once and for all the
uselessness of peaceful propaganda. The sentences
ranged from one to three months' imprisonment in
the second division. Mrs. Leigh and Miss New
were dealt with separately at Bow Street but, as this
was not generally expected, very few people were
present. In the dimly lighted Court, with the
magistrate in his high backed chair regarding them
sternly from deep cavernous eyes, the two little
women in the great dock with its heavy iron railings
looked strangely forlorn. What dreadful sentence,
we wondered, was in store for these, the first of the
Suffragettes to deliberately throw stones! Mr.
Muskett in prosecuting them for doing wilful damage
to the value of ten shillings at the Prime Minister's
residence, spoke of them with extreme harshness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
urging that they should be sent to prison
without the option of a fine. Though the Magistrate
rebuked the women for the methods they had
adopted, we felt that he was impressed by their demeanour
and that he was loth to sentence them. He
ordered that they should go to prison for two months
in the third division without the option of a fine.
The sentence was heavy enough, but lighter than
we had feared in view of the fact that many of the
other women were to remain in prison for three
months.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Christabel Pankhurst inviting the public to "rush" the House of Commons

</div>

<p>When the House of Commons met on the same
afternoon, several members of every party in the
House asked, as they had done on previous occasions,
that the women should be treated as political
offenders. As before, however, Mr. Gladstone
sheltered himself behind the statement, which nobody
believed, that the Magistrate was alone responsible
for placing the women in the second and third
divisions and that he himself had no power to interfere.</p>

<p>On the morning after the "raid" the newspapers
had mostly contented themselves with rebuking the
women for what they had done, but in a few days
there came a reaction of feeling which was accelerated
both by the harshness of the sentences imposed
and by Mr. Gladstone's refusal to mitigate the rigours
of the prison treatment.</p>

<p>The country was now overwhelmed by one of
those terribly oppressive heat waves which come
upon us suddenly from time to time and are borne
with such difficulty in our usually temperate climate,
and there gradually leaked out from Holloway accounts
of the Suffragist women fainting in the exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
yards<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and being seized with illness in their
cells. There happened to be some cases of measles
in the prison hospital, and Miss Elsie Howey, having
contracted the disease there, was exceedingly ill
for many weeks.</p>

<p>All these things combined to focus public attention
upon the harsh treatment of the Suffragette prisoners.
On July 10th the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> in a leading
Article said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It demands considerable obtuseness to believe, as some persons
apparently do, that close confinement in the heat of
Summer or the cold of Winter within a solitary and unwholesome
cell, deprival of exercise for twenty-three hours
out of the twenty-four, subjection to menial authority, ignorance
of the welfare of one's friends, the performing of
dull and alien tasks, deprivation of writing materials, partial
suffocation and the wearing of ugly, ill-fitting clothing
that has already been worn by the vilest criminals, are for
delicate and sensitive women the elements of a comedy.
They compose a great and terrible torture.... Because
they are suffering for an idea their stringent imprisonment
is indefensible. It violates the public conscience and
the law and the courts cannot wage war on the public conscience
without forfeiting respect and authority.</p>

<small>JULY TO OCTOBER, 1908</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Great Demonstrations in the Provinces. Mr. Lloyd
George Accuses Women of Being Paid to Interrupt
Him. Arrest of the Three Leaders and the Fifth
Women's Parliament.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Meanwhile, in spite of the fact that the Union
had thought it necessary to again resort to militant
tactics the campaign of great provincial demonstrations
was proceeded with, and included gatherings of
100,000 people in Shipley Glen, Bradford, on May
31st, 15,000 at Heaton Park, Manchester, on July
19th, of 100,000 on Woodhouse Moor, Leeds, on
July 26th, of many thousands, also, on the Durdham
Downs Clifton, near Bristol, on September 19th, in
Nottingham Forest, on July 18th, at Huddersfield,
on September 27th, at Rawtenstall, on September
3rd, and in the Market Square Leicester on July
30th.</p>

<p>During these months, by-elections had been fought
in Pembrokeshire, Haggerston and Newcastle. At
the first of these the Liberal majority was reduced.
At the second a Liberal majority of 1,401 was turned
to a Conservative majority of 1,143. At Newcastle,
the Suffragettes swept all before them, and, when
Mrs. Pankhurst announced to a great meeting on
the Town Moor that five of the released prisoners
were shortly to arrive, an immense procession was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
formed to do them honour, and the railway authorities
placed the entrance usually reserved for Royalty
at the disposal of the Suffragettes. Almost the
whole population turned out to cheer the women.
There seemed no doubt the Government nominee
would be defeated, and so it proved, for a Liberal
majority of no fewer than 6,481 votes was turned
into a majority of 2,143 for the Conservatives.</p>

<p>After the poll, Mr. Renwick, the successful candidate
said: "I must express admiration for those
who have addressed meetings on behalf of Women's
Suffrage. They have taught us a lesson as to how
to speak and conduct a campaign. I am sure we all
wish that they may realise their hopes." The defeated
Liberal candidate also expressed the hope that
the women would be voting at the next election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at almost every meeting addressed
by a Cabinet Minister throughout the length and
breadth of the land, the Suffragettes had been in evidence,
and when they had been unable to secure admission
to the halls, they had held meetings outside.</p>

<p>At some of Mr. Lloyd George's meetings the
women hecklers were treated with special brutality,
and this was certainly increased by the exclamations
of the Cabinet Minister on the platform. He
called his interrupters "sorry specimens of womanhood,"
and added, "I think a gag ought to be tried."
So calculated to aggravate the already savage behaviour
of the stewards were his remarks, that quite
a storm of protest was raised and Mr. Lloyd George
found it necessary to write to the <i>Times</i>, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Owing to the constant interruptions to which I was subjected,
it was doubtless difficult for me to make myself clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and fully understood, and the difficulty which I found in
speaking was no doubt shared by the Press in reporting.
Under these circumstances I am not surprised that some
misunderstanding may have arisen, and I appeal to the
courtesy of your columns to remove it.</p>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, when he spoke at Swansea, his remarks
were even more unguarded, and he urged on
the stewards with such cries as, "By and by we
shall have to order sacks for them, and the first to
interrupt shall disappear," and "fling them ruthlessly
out." At that there were shouts of laughter
from Liberals on the platform mingled with cries of
"frog march them!" Then he taunted the women.
"I wonder how much she has been paid for coming
here," he called as one was being dragged away.
His supporters responded with cheers and shouts of
"Tory money," and he added "I am sorry to say
this business is becoming a profession."</p>

<p>On hearing of this remark, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence
wrote to Mr. Lloyd George as Treasurer of the
Women's Social and Political Union to protest
against his suggestion that the women who interrupted
Cabinet Ministers did so as a "profession."
In doing so she forwarded him a copy of our Annual
Report. He replied by repeating his insinuations
and calling attention to the fact that the Report
showed considerable sums of money to have been
dispensed in "salaries," "travelling expenses," and
"special board and lodging." Mrs. Lawrence then
stated that whilst, like every other political organisation,
the Women's Social and Political Union had its
paid staff and organisers and that whilst these organisers
were occasionally present at Cabinet Ministers'
meetings, the protests were almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
made by members of the Union who gave their time
and work freely. Thus, of the thirty women who
had interrupted Mr. George at the Queen's Hall on
July 28th and had been ejected, twenty-nine had
never at any time been in receipt of any salary from
the Union, and of the five women who had taken
part in the protest made at Swansea, four had never
been in receipt of any salary from the Union and the
fifth was not receiving any salary at the time.</p>

<p>The eyes of all Suffragettes were now fixed upon
the opening of Parliament for the autumn session,
which was to take place on October 12th. The
Prime Minister was again asked that facilities should
be given for the House of Commons to proceed with
the Women's Enfranchisement Bill, but he again refused
and the W. S. P. U. then determined that a
fifth Parliament of Women must be called together
on October 13th, and that a deputation from it must
again seek an interview with the Prime Minister.
It was thought desirable that, as on the last occasion,
the general public should be present, both that they
might see what actually happened between the
women and the authorities, and also that it might be
shown to the Government that many thousands of
men and women were prepared to support the Suffragettes
and to answer to their call. Knowing well
the difficulty of bringing anything prominently before
the public in these modern days of crowded
interests except with the aid of the advertisement
afforded by notices in the Press, and knowing also
that in this epoch of Press sensationalism that nothing,
even if it be as serious as a struggle between life
and death, is reported except when it is new, the
Committee of the Union cast about in their minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
for some racy and attractive means of drawing public
attention to the forthcoming deputation. At last
the phrase, "Help the Suffragettes to rush the House
of Commons" was hit upon, because of its double
suggestion and echo of the oft heard but almost always
ridiculously unfounded complaint that legislation
is being "rushed" through our too talkative
and dilatory Parliament. The words were at once
embodied in a handbill of which the accompanying
illustration is a facsimile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another body of agitators who had
become impatient with the Government's treatment
of their own particular question, were preparing to
take similar steps. Even in the early summer, there
had been signs that the forthcoming winter was to
be one of exceptional hardship for the working
classes, and the Labour Members of Parliament had
then begun to urge upon the President of the Local
Government Board the need for making extensive
preparations for helping the great numbers of persons
whom they foresaw would fall out of employment.
The distress that had been foreshadowed
was now upon the country, a feeling of general discontent
prevailed, and rumours of all sorts of wild
doings were beginning to spread. Bodies of unemployed
came marching up to London from the provincial
towns and held meetings on the Embankment
and Tower Hill at which it was announced that
there was to be a great gathering of the unemployed
in Parliament Square on Monday, October 12th, and
that an attempt was then to be made to see the
Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government
Board and the President of the Board of
Trade. On Sunday, October 4th, a meeting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
unemployed was held under the auspices of the Social
Democratic Federation in Trafalgar Square,
and some very inflammatory speeches were delivered.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The words of Mr. Will Thorne, M.P. for
West Ham, were milder than those of some others.
In the course of his remarks he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Next Tuesday the Suffragettes admit that they are going
to "rush" the House. There is nothing there. If you
want to "rush" anything, you rush where there is something
to be rushed; not the House. I say that if you are
in earnest, the first thing that you ought to do is to rush
the bakers' shops. You ought to rush every bally bakers'
shop in London rather than starve. I suppose it means that
a few of you will get locked up. You would be better off
in prison.</p>
</div>

<p>He added that until the unemployed struck "the
fear of man" into the hearts of the Government,
the Government would do nothing for them. After
the unemployed meeting was over, there was some
disorder in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross and
two or three men were arrested.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 11th, the Women's Social
and Political Union held a meeting in Trafalgar
Square at which Mrs. Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst,
and Mrs. Drummond spoke from the plinth
of the Nelson column, whilst the police who were
present in great numbers, took notes of all that was
said.</p>

<p>On Monday, October 12th, came the day of the
unemployed demonstration, but, though much had
been feared and expected of it, little happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Small groups of unemployed began to arrive in the
Square at an early hour, but a pacificatory attitude
was adopted by the authorities and though the police
kept the crowd moving in the thoroughfares they did
not prevent the assemblage of a number of people in
the centre of the green in front of Westminster
Abbey. Many of the men were allowed to enter
the House, where Mr. John Burns assured them
that within a few days the Prime Minister would
make a pronouncement in the House of Commons
pledging the Government to provide some measure
of relief.</p>

<p>During the week that had passed, the last before
their demonstration, the Suffragettes had been working
strenuously. The "rush" handbills had been
circulated broadcast, a "Votes for Women" kite
had floated constantly over the House of Commons,
and a steam launch, decorated with banners and
posters announcing the deputation had steamed up
and down the river. Everything had gone on without
let or hindrance and new recruits, anxious to
take part in the demonstration had been eagerly presenting
themselves. Yet from day to day there
grew the knowledge that the authorities were lying
in wait to take some sudden step against the Union
and the women began to notice that the police were
shadowing all the prominent members of the Committee
and were constantly hanging about the offices
at Clement's Inn. The blow came in the shape of
the following document, a copy of which was served
upon Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Drummond, and Christabel
Pankhurst about midday on Monday, October
12th:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Information has been laid this day by the Commissioner
of Police for that you, in the month of October, in the year
1908, were guilty of conduct likely to provoke a breach of
the peace by initiating and causing to be initiated, by publishing
and causing to be published, a certain handbill, calling
upon and inciting the public to do a certain wrongful
and illegal act, viz., to rush the House of Commons at 7:30
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span> on October 13th inst.</p>

<p>You are therefore hereby summoned to appear before the
Court of Summary Jurisdiction now sitting at the Bow
Street Police Station on Monday, October 12th, at the hour
of 3:30, to answer to the said information and to shew cause
why you and each of you shall not be ordered to find sureties
of good behaviour.</p>

<p>
(Signed) <span class="smcap">H. Curtis Bennett.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It was felt that the summons had been issued to
withdraw public attention from the deputation to
Mr. Asquith which was to go from the Caxton Hall
next evening. Therefore it was decided to disregard
it for the present, but at the crowded At Home
in the Queen's Hall that afternoon the members of
the Union were informed that it had been received.
The devotion and loyalty to leaders, always so
strong in the Union, was now at fever heat. Numbers
of constables were posted at the doors, official
police reporters were present and it was momentarily
expected that the police would force their way on
to the platform and arrest the three. The excitement
culminated when someone said that a police
inspector was entering the building. Then hundreds
of women leapt to their feet and cried out that
the officers should not be allowed to enter and that
they would never let them take their leaders. But
this proved to be a false alarm, for it was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
messenger to say that the summonses had been adjourned
until the following morning. Mrs. Pankhurst,
Christabel and Mrs. Drummond decided not
to give themselves up till evening and they accordingly
sent the following note to the Court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We shall not be at the offices at 4, Clement's Inn until
six o'clock to-day, but at that hour we shall all three be
entirely at your disposal.</p>
</div>

<p>This did not appease the authorities in any way
and a warrant for their arrest was immediately issued
with an order to Inspector Jarvis to execute it
without delay. Having guessed that this might
happen Mrs. Drummond had quietly arranged to
spend her last day of liberty with friends whilst my
mother and sister had merely made their way to one
of the upper flats in Clement's Inn, No. 119, which
was rented by Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and
to which a roof garden was attached. This had
scarcely been done when the police swooped down
upon our offices to demand the three, and on no information
being forthcoming they remained roaming
about the passages and standing in the doorways,
trying to get information from postmen, porters and
tradesmen, all day long.</p>

<p>At six o'clock, Mrs. Drummond returned,
promptly to the moment, and the two other prisoners
walked calmly downstairs and into the offices.
Inspector Jarvis and a detective in plain clothes were
already waiting and, after the warrant for their arrest
had been read out to them, they were taken in a
cab to Bow Street. The Court having risen, it was
impossible for the trial to be proceeded with that
evening and when they applied to be allowed out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
bail until the next morning their application was refused
and they were hurried away to the cells. The
police court cells are about five feet wide by seven
feet long, exceedingly badly lit and furnished only with
a wooden bench attached to the wall and a sanitary
convenience. There are neither washing utensils
nor bed of any kind, but each prisoner is given a
dark and dirty-looking rug in which to wrap herself
during the night. Mrs. Pankhurst at once
claimed her right as an untried prisoner to communicate
with the outside world and immediately despatched
telegrams to several Members of Parliament.
A weary hour or two went by. Then the
door of Mrs. Pankhurst's cell was thrown wide
open, and the tall, breezy presence of Mr. Murray,
Liberal Member of Parliament for East Aberdeenshire,
appeared. He was horrified to find the three
ladies in these unpleasant surroundings and, promising
to return soon, he hurried to the Savoy Hotel,
and there arranged for various comforts to be sent
in to the prison. Then he prevailed upon the
authorities to allow the three Suffragettes to take their
evening meal together and, in an incredibly short
space of time, they were ushered into the matron's
room.</p>

<p>The bare little place with its dingy walls, its
wooden chairs and two deal tables, had been wonderfully
transformed. Numbers of tall wax candles
had been lighted, the tables were laid with silver,
flowers and brightly coloured fruit, and three waiters
were ready to serve the prisoners with a most
elaborate meal. At the same time, Mr. Murray,
with his face wreathed in smiles, was superintending
the carrying in to the cells of three comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>beds. The management of the Savoy had thrown
themselves into the enterprise with the greatest
eagerness and, having acted throughout with almost
overwhelming kindness and courtesy, ended by refusing
to charge anything at all for what they had
provided. As well may be imagined, the three comrades
were in no haste to finish the meal and return
to the dark and solitary cells.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Reading the Warrant, October 13th, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile there were stirring doings at Westminster.
All police leave had been stopped for the
day in the whole of the metropolitan area, and every
mounted policeman had been called up to headquarters.
Parliament Square itself was cut off from
the rest of London as though it were in a state of
siege, by double cordons of foot police, each of
them five deep, which were drawn up across all the
streets leading to it. Within these barriers the
great area, usually thronged with vehicles of all
kinds and hurrying passers-by, was emptied of all
but the few mounted police who rode about in it,
the ring of their horses' hoofs sounding strangely
sharp and loud, and an occasional wheeled vehicle
carrying some Member to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Outside the massed ranks of police the whole
population of London seemed to have gathered.
The newspapers said that it was just like Mafeking
night without the disorder. Members of Parliament
came out from time to time to watch the
scene, amongst the spectators being Mr. John Burns,
Mr. Haldane, Mr. Walter Long and Mr. Lloyd
George, who came with his little daughter, a fair
haired child of six years old. Soon a deputation of
eleven women with Miss Wallace Dunlop a descendant
of the great William Wallace, as their leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
marched out of the Caxton Hall with Mrs. Lawrence's
instructions to oppose with spiritual force
the physical force which the authorities had arrayed
in such strength against them, ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>A cheer from the waiting crowd greeted them as
they gained the street, and though some fifty constables
attempted to bar their passage into Victoria
Street, the people swept them through. At last
near the end of Victoria Street, they were met by a
body of police and the Inspector in Charge asked
Miss Wallace Dunlop that the deputation should
wait for a few moments in order that he might bring
up some mounted police to clear a way to the House
of Commons. She agreed to wait until eight o'clock
but when that time came the Inspector returned and
said the deputation could not pass. Then, faithful
to their trust, the little band of women pressed
bravely forward and commenced their hopelessly
unequal struggle with the police. In a moment
their ranks were broken and they were scattered
hopelessly amongst the crowd of constables and sightseers.
Before long a number had been arrested and
the others were swept far away from their destination.
When the news of the first deputation's fate
reached the Caxton Hall a second body of women
numbering some thirty or forty, marched out to take
their place. Like their predecessors, they too
reached the top of Victoria Street where the
mounted police were still waiting. Then suddenly,
Mrs. Leigh, a slight agile figure in white, dashed
forward from their midst and threw herself into the
mounted line, seizing a police horse by the bridle
with either hand. The horses reared and kicked
furiously, the constables closed upon her and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>flung to the ground. From time to time several isolated
women succeeded by strategy in getting quite
close to the House of Commons and one even found
her way into one of the underground passages used
by Members of Parliament. In every case they
were captured by the police and either placed under
arrest or dragged away and pushed outside the
guarding cordons into the crowd. At last so fearful
did the authorities become that the women might
be concealed at other strategic points that they proceeded
to thoroughly search every corner of Westminster
Abbey and with their lanterns were to be
seen amongst the buttresses and pinnacles of St. Margaret's
Church, searching for Suffragettes. Yet
with all their vigilance they were circumvented, for
one woman succeeded in outwitting everyone and
entered the sacred chamber itself. The lady in
question was Mrs. Margaret Travers Simons, Mr.
Keir Hardie's Parliamentary Secretary, who, whilst
a believer in the Votes for Women Movement, had
never taken any active part in it. On her way to
the House that evening she had been deeply moved
by the violent scenes. As she sat thinking of them
in the Lobby, and realising that the Suffragettes,
struggle as they might, would never reach the House,
the thought suddenly flashed across her mind that
she herself had the power to make the appeal and
protest which was impossible to them. Seized by
an irresistible impulse, she sent in for Mr. T. H. W.
Idris, the Liberal Member for Flint Boroughs, and
asked him to take her to look through a little window,
known as the "peep hole," which is situated on
the left side of the glass doors leading into the
House of Commons, and to which Members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Parliament had the privilege of taking their lady
friends. He agreed, and, on reaching the window,
she mounted a seat, which is in front of it in order
that she might get a clear view of the chamber.
After a moment or two she descended and Mr. Idris
turned towards the outer Lobby thinking that she
was about to accompany him. In that instant, she
pushed open the double glass doors and, before anyone
could prevent her, darted into the Chamber
and rushed up the central aisle towards the Speaker's
chair, calling upon the House to "attend to the
women's question!" She was seized by one of the
attendants at the Bar, a big, powerful man who carried
her back into the lobby, and in a very short
space of time she had been handed over to a police
inspector, conducted out of the House of Commons,
and allowed to go free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Trial of the Three Leaders. Mr. Herbert
Gladstone and Mr. Lloyd George in the Witness
Box.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>On the morning of October 14th began the trial
both of the three leaders who had been arrested by
warrant and the twenty-one women whom they were
said to have incited to break the peace. Excited
crowds early assembled in Bow Street, and besieged
the doors of the Police Court, begging the unyielding
custodians for admission. In the dark passageways
and lobbies of the Court were numbers of
women, imploring the officials to allow them to pass
into the Court itself. The public enter by a door
at the back of the room and here there is a space
where visitors may stand. This space was now
crowded with women, pressing closely against the
wooden barrier which cut them from off the narrow
rows of equally crowded wooden seats, where the
friends and relatives of the prisoners, who could obtain
the ear of some kindly officer, were allowed to
sit. In front of these seats is the dock itself&mdash;a
wooden bench some six feet long, empty as yet, and
surrounded by a heavy iron railing on three sides, the
fourth to be guarded by a policeman when the prisoners
arrive. In front and at one side of the dock
are the benches for the Press, which that morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
contained representatives from all the leading newspapers.
In front of this again, divided by a barrier
and on a lower level so that one sees little more than
the heads of its occupants, was another bench where
Mr. Muskett, the solicitor for the Prosecution who
had so often appeared against the Suffragettes, and
other minions of the law now sat. In front again
and placed at right angles to this bench is the witness
box&mdash;a little wooden pen with a foolish
wooden canopy which looks as though it were meant
for keeping out the rain. On the right, opposite
the witness box, are two rows of seats, each entered
by a little wooden door, like church pews, where
counsel and distinguished strangers sit. In the well
between the witness box and these seats sit the recording
clerks and other officials, and opposite to
them, and facing the whole court is the Magistrate's
high-backed chair and his table. Mr. Curtis Bennett,
the Magistrate who was to try the case, sat
there now, handsome and dignified, and looking the
picture of a high-bred eighteenth-century squire.</p>

<p>The familiar figures of Mrs. Pankhurst, Christabel
and Mrs. Drummond were soon ushered into
the dock, and then Christabel began by asking the
Magistrate not to deal with the case in that Court,
but to send it for trial by Judge and Jury, her object
being to secure that Suffragette cases should no
longer be decided by a body of Police Court officials,
whom we had every reason to believe were acting
under the direct instructions of the Government
against whom our agitation was directed, but should
instead be submitted to a body of ordinary citizens.
She urged that, under section seventeen of the Summary
Jurisdiction Act of 1879, she and her co-defendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
were entitled to the option of being tried
where they desired, and she wished now to state that
they desired that the case should go before a jury.
Mr. Curtis Bennett bent his head and smiled, saying,
"Yes, yes, but we will go on with the case now."
She pressed him to at once give an answer to the
point which she had raised, but he replied that he
could not do so until he had heard the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Muskett, then rose to prosecute. Speaking
quickly in a low voice and showing considerable irritation,
he began by complaining that the defendants
had failed to obey a summons to appear, firstly on
Monday and secondly on Tuesday morning, to answer
to the charge of having been guilty of conduct
likely to provoke a breach of the peace. Then in
the most fastidious manner and with clearly expressed
disgust, he proceeded to set forth the details
of the case. He explained that, on October 8th, Inspector
Jarvis had visited the offices of the Women's
Social and Political Union and had there seen Mrs.
Drummond with Miss Christabel Pankhurst. Miss
Pankhurst had said, "What about the 13th? Have
you seen our new bills?" and had produced the
handbill which formed the foundation of the present
charge. It was worded: "Votes for Women.
Men and women help the Suffragettes to rush the
House of Commons on Tuesday, October 13th, at
7:30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>" In showing this to Inspector Jarvis,
Miss Pankhurst had said that the words "to rush"
were not in sufficiently large type and that they were
to be made much more distinct.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 11th, the Defendants had
held a meeting in Trafalgar Square, to which Mr.
Muskett objected, because it had caused "an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
amount of additional labour to be thrown upon
the shoulders of the police." At this meeting, he
asserted gravely, speeches had been delivered by the
defendants inciting those present to carry out the
programme of rushing the House of Commons.
"You will agree sir," said Mr. Muskett, "that such
conduct as that cannot be tolerated in this country."
Finally he asked on behalf of the Commissioner of
Police that the defendants should be ordered to be
bound over to keep the peace.</p>

<p>Stout, red-faced Superintendent Wells, whom we
usually found most friendly and obliging, now, looking
very cross and uncomfortable, lumbered into the
witness box. After taking the oath he gave evidence
in regard to a visit of his own to the offices at Clement's
Inn. He said that Mrs. Pankhurst had then
shown him a copy of a letter which had been sent by
the Women's Social and Political Union to Mr. Asquith.
This document pointed out that at many
large demonstrations all over the country, resolutions
had been carried, calling upon the Government to
adopt the Women's Enfranchisement Bill and also
that, at a succession of by-elections, the voters had
shown unmistakably their desire that the Government
should deal with the question without further
delay. It concluded by asking the Prime Minister
to inform the Union as to whether the Government
would carry the Bill into law during the autumn session.</p>

<p>After the Superintendent had read the letter, Mrs.
Pankhurst had told him that, if Mr. Asquith returned
a satisfactory reply to it, nothing would take
place on October 13th save a great cheer for the
Government, but that, if he did not, there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
a demonstration and the women would get into the
House of Commons. "I said, 'You cannot get there
for the police will not let you unless you come with
cannon,'" the Superintendent went on, looking very
imposing, and explained that Mrs. Pankhurst had
then stated that "no lethal weapons" would be used.
She had also said, "Mr. Asquith will be responsible
if there is any disorder and accident."</p>

<p>Superintendent Wells next described the meeting
in Trafalgar Square where he had seen Mrs. Drummond
distributing the "rush" handbills. He said
that he looked upon her as a "very active leader of
the Suffragettes" and that she frequently wore a
"uniform" with the word "general" or "generalissimo"
on the cap. He had told her that she and
Mrs. Pankhurst would be prosecuted. When questioned
by Mr. Muskett as to the happenings of the
previous evenings, Superintendent Wells said that
traffic had been "wholly disorganised" in the vicinity
of the House of Commons for four hours and
that for three hours the streets had been in "great
disorder"; that a very large body of police indeed
had been required to maintain the peace, that ten
persons had been treated at Westminster Hospital
and that seven or eight constables and sergeants had
been more or less injured.</p>

<p>It was now Christabel Pankhurst's turn to cross-examine
the Superintendent and he looked across the
dock at her very nervously. She first questioned
him as to the statement that had been made that she
and her companions in the dock had broken their
promise to appear at the court either on the Monday
or Tuesday morning, and drew from him the admission
that he had not received any undertaking "in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
actual words." She then changed the subject and
brightly asked him whether he was in the habit of
reading the official organ of the Union "Votes for
Women," to which he replied in the negative.
"You are not aware, then," she said, "that Mrs.
Pankhurst wrote the following words:"</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On October 13th in Parliament Square there will be
many thousands of people to see fair play between the women
and the Government. Let us keep their support and cooperation
by showing them, as we have done before, with
what quiet courage, self-restraint and determination, women
are fighting against tyranny and oppression on the part of
a Government which has been called the strongest of modern
times. It is by the exercise of courage and self-restraint
and persistent effort that we shall win in this unequal contest.</p>
</div>

<p>"There is nothing very inflammatory in those
words," she urged. "Does it really occur to you
that those words were circulated to incite a riot?"
But Mr. Wells shrugged his shoulders and answered
gruffly, "I am not complaining of that article, I am
complaining of those bills."</p>

<p>Then she asked whether the crowd in Trafalgar
Square was a disorderly one. He admitted that it
was not, but at the question "are you aware that any
member of the Government was there?" he looked
round at the Magistrate cautiously and said, "I do
not know that I should answer that." "You can
say yes or no," said Mr. Curtis Bennett, and when
the query was repeated the reply came, "I saw one
there." "Was it Mr. Lloyd George?" said Miss
Pankhurst with a smile, and at this there was laughter
in court, and even the Magistrate plainly showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
amusement. Mr. Wells flushed redder still and remained
silent. She next questioned the Superintendent
as to the nature of the speeches in Trafalgar
Square and the exact meaning of the word "rush,"
but he frequently took refuge in silence, and refused
to be drawn. It was plain that Mr. Wells was not
accustomed to being cross-examined by a prisoner in
the dock and that he did not at all like it. Just as
he began to hope that it was nearly over, she suddenly
changed the subject, and asked him whether
he had been present when Mr. John Burns had made
the famous speech which led to his arrest. "I was
not," he answered, and she asked, "Are you aware
that the words he used at that time were very much
more calculated to lead to destruction and damage
to property than anything that we have said?" "I
am not aware of it," said Mr. Wells looking appealingly
across to Mr. Muskett. "You are aware
however that John Burns is a member of the present
Government and is responsible jointly with his colleagues,
for the action which has been taken against
us?" "Yes," he answered, almost without thinking.
"You are aware of that, you are aware that
the law-breaker is now sitting in judgment upon those
who have done far less than he did himself?" she
said, pressing home her advantage. "You are
aware of <i>that</i>?" she repeated after a pause. But
there was no reply.</p>

<p>Next she asked whether the Superintendent had
heard the Trafalgar Square speech of Mr. Will
Thorne, M.P. in which he had advised the people
to rush the bakers' shops? Mr. Wells felt on
safer ground now, for this did not concern a Cabinet
Minister. "I did not hear it," he ventured to answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
"but it was reported to me." "Well, does
it occur to you that his language was far more dangerous
to the public peace than the language that we
have used?" "I am not complaining of your language,"
he again answered doggedly, "I am complaining
of the bills." "Well, the language that
was used on the bills, he <i>spoke, he used the word
'rush,'</i> moreover he incited people to riot and violence,"
she urged. "Does it occur to you that his
action is more reprehensible than ours?" "It occurs
to me," said Mr. Wells sulkily, "that he might
be prosecuted the same as you are." "You are not
aware whether proceedings will be taken?" she
asked with an air of pleased interest&mdash;but Mr.
Curtis Bennett interposed to say that that question
could not be allowed. Then she asked the Superintendent
whether he knew that Mr. Gladstone had
stated in the House of Commons that the proceedings
against herself and her colleagues had not been
instituted by the Government, but by the police.
He tried to evade her, saying, "You have kept me
so busily engaged that I have not had time to look
at the papers this morning," but before he left the
box he had virtually admitted that, in spite of Mr.
Gladstone's denial, the Government was responsible
for the prosecution.</p>

<p>The next witness was our old friend, Inspector
Jarvis with whom we had had negotiations in all
sorts of matters connected both with our peaceful
and militant propaganda ever since our campaign in
London had been started. He is a tall thin man
with a pale, thoughtful face and is not at all like the
typical police officer. As a rule he has the most
kindly and courteous manners, but to-day he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
thoroughly ill-tempered and refused to look directly
at any of us. He was called upon by Mr. Muskett
to read the notes which he had taken of Christabel's
speech at the Sunday meeting in Trafalgar Square
and he did so in halting and expressionless tones:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I wish you all to be there on the evening of the 13th and
I hope that this will be the end of this movement. On
June 30th we succeeded in driving Mr. Asquith underground;
he is afraid of us and so are the Government.
Years ago John Bright told the people that it was only by
lining the streets from Charing Cross to Westminster that
they could impress the Government. Well, we are only
taking a leaf out of his book. We want you to help
the women to rush their way into the House of Commons.
You won't get locked up because you have the vote. If you
are afraid, we will take the lead, and you will follow us.
We know we shall win because we are in the right.</p>
</div>

<p>Then, just as a child at school who does not understand
the words, he read an extract also from Mrs.
Pankhurst's speech:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On Tuesday evening at Caxton Hall we shall ask those
who support the women to come to Parliament Square.
There will be a deputation of women who have no right
in the House of Commons to a seat<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> there such as men
have. The Government&mdash;does not know&mdash;its own mind&mdash;it&mdash;changes&mdash;so,
but we do know&mdash;that we want the
vote&mdash;and mean to have it. When the people in Parliament
Square&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>But Mr. Muskett interrupted, he had heard
enough. He went on to ask if it were not a fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
that, on Monday morning, Inspector Jarvis had himself
served a summons upon the defendants to appear
in court on the afternoon of the same day and on
the Inspector assenting, he said, "I want to know
about this question as to whether they promised to
attend here or not." Inspector Jarvis hesitated,
"Well, Miss Christabel," he began, "I saw her
alone, and she said, 'We are not afraid, we shall be
there.'" "Then," said Mr. Muskett, "I believe
they were served with a summons to appear on the
following morning at eleven o'clock." "Yes."
"And as they did not put in an appearance then, a
warrant was issued?" "Yes." "And you had to
wait there for them until they surrendered to you?"
Again the Inspector assented, looking very much
aggrieved.</p>

<p>Christabel Pankhurst began her cross-examination
by closely questioning Mr. Jarvis on this very point
and soon drew from him the admission that no
definite promise had been made. As she was speaking
to him his face cleared visibly and he generously
owned that he had been mistaken. Similar evidence
from a third Inspector closed the case for the prosecution.</p>

<p>Christabel then applied for an adjournment and
the Magistrate agreed to allow the case to stand over
for a week. The three prisoners being released on
bail for the time being.</p>

<p>As soon as this had been decided Mr. Curtis Bennett
said that he would deal with the cases of the
women who had been arrested in Trafalgar Square,
and seven of these were soon ordered to undergo
from one to two months' imprisonment in default
of being bound over for twelve months. As each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
woman was asked if she had anything to say for
herself, she replied, "I demand a trial by jury."
This seemed to annoy Mr. Curtis Bennett considerably
and he became more and more irate until the
fifth woman had spoken. Then he laughed and said,
"I see this has evidently been arranged beforehand."
It was unfortunate for the fourth woman that he
had not recovered his temper earlier for, though a
first offender arrested for doing practically nothing,
she received a sentence of two months' imprisonment,
whilst one month only was served out to others of
the same class. Mrs. Leigh, as this was the third
time that she had been charged, received a sentence
of three months. Thirteen of the Suffragettes
pleaded that they wished to obtain legal advice, and
were remanded for a week, at the end of which time
milder methods obtained, for their sentences ranged
merely from three weeks to one month.</p>

<p>Next day, Thursday, October 15th, a summons was
issued against Mr. Will Thorne, M.P. for inciting
the unemployed to rush the bakers' shops, and when
his case came up on the 21st, he expressed the belief
that no summons would have been issued against
him but for the remarks made by Christabel Pankhurst
during the Suffragette trial. He declared that
in speaking as he had done his object had been to
persuade the unemployed not to take part in the
Women's Demonstration in Parliament Square, because
he felt sure that they would get into trouble if
they did so, and urged that his speech had been taken
too literally. Mr. Curtis Bennett, however, ordered
him to be bound over in his own recognisances of
£200 and two sureties of £100 each to be of good
behaviour for twelve months or in default to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
prison for six months. Mr. Thorne agreed to be
bound over.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, October 21st, the trial of the Suffragette
leaders again came on and, whilst the Court
was just as crowded, the Press seats were even fuller
than before. Mr. Curtis Bennett seemed more than
ever dignified and magisterial. Everyone waited
with impatience and presently there was a stir in the
court, and, with much ceremony, some of the officers
opened the door by which the prisoners usually enter
and ushered in a group of gentlemen, who seated
themselves in the pew-like benches reserved for counsel
and distinguished persons. Then, preceded by a
stout, black-bearded gaoler, and with three or four
police on either side of them, the three Suffragettes
made their way into the dock. As soon as they had
seated themselves, Mr. Muskett rose and said in his
usual rather peevish and very indistinct tones that
the case for the Prosecution had been concluded on
the previous Wednesday.</p>

<p>After a short preliminary argument as to legal
forms between Christabel and the Magistrate and a
pledge that she should be allowed to submit her objections
later, there was a slight scuffling in those
important side benches, the pew doors were opened,
two of the gentlemen who had accompanied him
stepped aside and Mr. Lloyd George, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, came forward and passed across the
court into the witness box.</p>

<p>Seen for the first time, he is totally unlike what
one has been led to expect. Instead of the romantic-looking
Welsh bard, with black and very curly
hair, portrayed by the newspaper cartoons and drawings,
there stood, cooped up in the little witness box,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
with its useless-looking wooden canopy, a plain little
man, with a pale face, a long untidy moustache and
hair which, though he wears it somewhat long, as
it is in the pictures, has not the least suspicion of a
curl but lies limp and scanty and is a dull dingy
brown. At first he leant his arm on the front of the
witness box and looked across at the three prisoners
in the dock. He regarded Christabel Pankhurst
curiously, as well he might, for, in her fresh white
muslin dress whose one note of colour was the broad
band of purple white and green stripes around her
waist, with her soft brown hair uncovered, the little
silky curls with just a hint of gold in them clustering
about her neck, and, in this dingy place, her skin
looking even more brilliantly white and those rose
petal cheeks of hers even more exquisitely and vividly
flushed with purest pink than usual, she was as
bright and dainty as a newly opened flower, and with
all her look of perfect health and vigour, appeared
so slender and so delicately knit as to have little
more of substance in her than a briar rose. But
she was to triumph over her opponent in the witness
box, not by her grace and freshness and by the outer
aspect of her vivid glowing personality, but by her
sparkling wit, her biting sarcasm and by the force
and depth of her arguments. And these went home,
not merely as they can be set down here in cold dull
print, but far more truly, because they were enhanced
by the everchanging eloquence of gesture,
voice, and facial expression&mdash;by a lift of the
eyebrows, a turn of the head, a heightening of the
lovely rose colour that flooded sometimes as far as
the white throat and as quickly ebbed again, a sweep
of the slender hand or a turn of that slight virile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
frame. All these, because so perfectly they echoed
and expressed her thoughts, could lend to even the
baldest and tritest words, a fanciful humour, a delicate
irony, or an inexorable force.</p>

<p>As she rose to examine Mr. Lloyd George, she
began quite formally, but with a cheerful and pleasant
manner asking whether he had been present at
the Trafalgar Square meetings on October 11th?
and whether he had seen a copy of the bills which
were being distributed? "Yes," he replied, with
just the least suspicion of a smile, "a young lady
gave one to me the moment I arrived. It invited
me to rush the House of Commons." "How did
you interpret the invitation conveyed to you as a
member of the audience?" she asked next with a
brisk business-like air. "What did you think we
wanted you to do?" He replied pompously, "I
really should not like to place an interpretation upon
the document. I do not think it is quite my function."
"Well, I am speaking to you as a member
of the general public," she urged, refusing to be put
off. "Imagine you were not at the meeting at all,
but were walking up the Strand, and someone gave
you a copy of this Bill, and you read it&mdash;'Help the
Suffragettes to rush the House of Commons.' And
suppose you forgot you were a member of the Government
and regarded yourself just as an ordinary
person like myself&mdash;quite unofficial," she added,
smiling, and with a little quick shake of her shoulders.
"What would you think you were called
upon to do?" "Really, I should not like to be
called upon to undertake so difficult a task as to interpret
that document," was the tart reply, but
Christabel went on persuasively, "Now this word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>'rush,' which seems to be at the bottom of it all,
what does it mean?" She waited with parted lips
and raised eyebrows for a reply. It came unwillingly.
"I understood the invitation from Mrs.
Pankhurst was to force an entrance to the House of
Commons." "No, no, I want you to keep your
mind concentrated on the bill," she corrected. "Let
us forget what Mrs. Pankhurst said. What did the
Bill say?" "I really forget what the Bill said," he
snapped out sharply. She repeated the phrase to
him graciously&mdash;"Help the Suffragettes to rush the
House of Commons." "Yes, that is it," he assented,
and she said, "I want you to define the word
'rush.'" "I cannot undertake to do that." "You
cannot?" she asked incredulously. "No, Miss
Pankhurst, I cannot." "Well," she replied, "I will
suggest some definitions to you. I find that in
'Chambers' English Dictionary' one of the meanings
of the word is 'an eager demand.' Now, what
do you think of that?" "I cannot enter into competition
with 'Chambers' Dictionary.' I am prepared
to accept it," he said stolidly.</p>

<div id="Illus15" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="500" height="515" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Miss Christabel Pankhurst questioning
Mr. Herbert Gladstone</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George was beginning to turn his head
away from her and to show every sign of unwillingness
to continue answering. Her imperturbable
good humour made the situation harder for him to
bear. As Max Beerbohm in the <i>Saturday Review</i>
said, "His Celtic fire burned very low; and the contrast
between the buoyancy of the girl and the depression
of the statesman was almost painful.
Youth and an ideal, on the one hand, and on the
other, middle age and no illusions left over."</p>

<p>But Christabel appeared not to notice his discomfiture:
"'Urgent pressure of business.' That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
another meaning. Now, if you were asked to help
the Suffragettes to make an eager demand to the
House of Commons that they should give votes to
women, would you feel that we were calling upon
you to do an illegal act?" "That is not for me to
say." Here Mr. Curtis Bennett interposed. "The
witness is perfectly right. This is for me to say
on the evidence. I have not interfered so far,"
but Christabel went on unheedingly and continued
gravely reading from her list of definitions.
"There is another sense in which the word 'rush'
is used and I think it will be of some interest to you.
We use it in this connexion, to 'rush' Bills through
Parliament." Mr. Lloyd George smiled in spite of
himself. "Yes, I think I have some experience of
that!" he said. "'On the rush' we are told in another
dictionary means 'in a hurry.' There is nothing
unlawful in being in a hurry." Mr. Lloyd
George shook himself impatiently, and the Magistrate
again interposed; this time with more severity.
"I have already said you must address those remarks
to me afterwards." But quite impassively
she held to her point and with her eyes upon the
witness continued, "Did you understand you were
asked to go in a hurry to the House of Commons to
make this eager demand for enfranchisement? Was
that the meaning which the Bill conveyed to you?"</p>

<p>In spite of his remonstrances Mr. Curtis Bennett
was evidently enjoying the scene, and his eyes twinkled
as he listened to the quickly and pleasantly directed
questions and to the slow, grudging replies.
Mr. George kept glancing at him angrily, and again
looking severe he said at last, "Miss Pankhurst, you
must take my ruling, please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>At this she changed her tack a little, questioning
Mr. Lloyd George as to the speeches he had heard
in Trafalgar Square and the demeanour of the crowd
and always making her inquiries with a polite air
of expectation that valuable information would be
forthcoming. When Mr. Lloyd George admitted
that he had heard some part of Miss Pankhurst's
speech, Christabel gravely inquired whether her
mother had threatened violence to any member of
the Government. "She did not invite the audience
to attack you in any way?" she asked. Then gradually,
through his fear of being made to appear ridiculous,
she brought him to admit that he had thought
that, if the public responded to the invitation to
"rush" the House of Commons, the consequences
would not be formidable and that there had been no
suggestion either that public or private property
should be damaged or that any personal violence
should be done.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly asked, "There were no words
used so likely to incite to violence as the advice you
gave at Swansea, that the women should be ruthlessly
flung out of your meeting?" This was unexpected.
Mr. Lloyd George frowned and remained
silent. Mr. Muskett stood up and appealed to the
Magistrate who interposed as was expected of him.
"This is quite irrelevant. That was a private
meeting, and not of the same character," he said reprovingly.
Christabel shook her head. "It was a
public meeting," she insisted. The Magistrate
waved his hand. "Well, private <i>in a sense</i>."
"They <i>are</i> private nowadays, that is quite true,"
she said pointedly, and obviously referring to the fact
that ticket meetings only were now addressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Cabinet Ministers, all women with a few selected exceptions
being rigidly excluded. Then she went on
to question Mr. Lloyd George as to the reason for
which the "rush" had been planned, but he obstinately
refused to answer.</p>

<p>Turning to the events during the so-called "rush"
on October 13th, she elicited the fact that Mr. Lloyd
George had taken his little six-year-old daughter
with him to watch the scene. "She was very
amused," he said with a malicious air. "You
thought it was quite safe for a child of those tender
years to be amongst the crowd?" asked Christabel,
and this time it was her turn to be a little severe.
"I was not amongst the crowd," he snapped, and
later, as if anxious to justify himself, added, "You
see, I only brought her from Downing Street to the
House, and I think that was clear." "The Prosecution
asserts that a serious breach of the peace took
place," was her next question. "Do you agree with
that statement?"</p>

<p>The Magistrate interrupted, "The Chancellor of
the Exchequer would have nothing to do with that,"
he said. "I believe you are a lawyer?" with a
quick change of front, she asked, turning politely to
Mr. Lloyd George. "Well, I hope I am," he answered
with a surly air. "Don't you think the
offence alleged against us would be more properly
described as 'Unlawful Assembly'?" "There
again, I was not put in the witness box to express an
opinion of that sort," he objected and the Magistrate
again supported him. She made another attempt:
"You have seen the form of summons
against us?" but he protested that he had not and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
did not know with what offence the prisoners were
charged. She explained to him the form of the
summons and explained that, owing to this, the defendants
were denied the right of trial by jury. He
merely replied, "I take it from you, Miss Pankhurst,
but I do not know."</p>

<p>An awkward question for Mr. Lloyd George was:
"Do you think that coercion is the right way of
dealing with political disorders?" He remained silent,
and the Magistrate tried to help him out, saying,
"It is not for the witness to express an opinion."
Christabel looked full at Mr. Lloyd George, asking,
"You refuse to answer?" "I do not refuse to answer,"
he said, not very honestly, "but I must obey
the decision of the Bench that I cannot express an
opinion about things in the witness box." "Am I
to understand that an answer must not be given to
that?" she appealed to the Magistrate. He replied,
"No." "Not even if the witness would like
to do it?" "No," he said, but she tried again.
"Well, is it likely to be a successful way of dealing
with political disturbances?" But the Magistrate
said, "That again, is not admissible." "But for
these restrictions, your Worship"&mdash;she broke out
with some heat, but he waved her aside and she
understood that he was implacable, so she turned
cheerfully to the witness and said, "Can you tell me
whether any interference with public order took
place in connexion with previous movements for
franchise reform?" "I should have thought that
that was an historical fact, Miss Pankhurst," he replied.
Again the Magistrate interposed to save
him. "That is cross-examination. The witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
cannot go into that." "In a <i>sense</i> he is my witness,"
she said, but though Mr. Curtis Bennett
smiled, he replied, "In <i>every sense</i> at present."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he had evidently seen the justice of
the remark and he did not object when a similar
question was now put. It was: "Have we not received
encouragement from you, or if not from you,
from your colleagues to take action of this kind?"
"I should be very much surprised to hear that, Miss
Pankhurst." Mr. George gave his answer pompously.
"You deny that we have been encouraged
by Liberal statesmen to take action of this kind?"
she said eagerly. "I simply express astonishment
at the statement," he said casting up his eyes with an
exaggerated, but not very convincing air of indignation.
"Have you ever heard these words spoken by
us at Trafalgar Square or by any Liberal statesman:"</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am sorry to say that if no instructions had ever been
addressed in political crises to the people of this country
except to remember to hate violence, to love order, and to
exercise patience, the liberties of this country would never
have been attained.</p>
</div>

<p>"Have you ever heard those words before?"
"I cannot call them to mind." At this reply there
was a sensation in the court, silent, but clearly felt.
"Those were the words of William Ewart Gladstone,"
said Christabel. "I accept your statement,
Miss Pankhurst," was Mr. Lloyd George's reply,
and when asked whether he was aware that in 1884
Mr. Chamberlain had threatened to march 100,000
men on London, he again replied, "I do not know."</p>

<p>Christabel's next question carried the war further
into the enemy's country. "Is it not a fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
you yourself have set us an example of revolt?"
she asked, but Mr. Curtis Bennett interposed to say
that the Chancellor need not answer that question,
and that she must not attack her own witness.
Whilst they were arguing, Mr. Lloyd George himself
burst in. "I never incited a crowd to violence,"
he said hotly, as though this form of defence had
only just occurred to him. "Not in the Welsh
Grave Yard case?" she asked. "No!" he said.
"You did not tell them to break down a wall and
disinter a body?" "I gave advice which was
found by the Court of Appeal to be sound legal advice,"
he said snappishly, and again almost turning
his back upon her. "<i>We</i> think that <i>we</i> are giving
sound advice too," she said.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Lloyd George became less and less
ready to give any reply, and his angry eyes were continually
calling for the Magistrate's intervention.</p>

<p>Miss Pankhurst then cited passages from "Taylor
on Evidence," to show that more latitude could be
allowed in questioning a witness who obviously appeared
to be hostile or interested for the other party,
or unwilling to give evidence, but Mr. Curtis Bennett
declared that none of these descriptions could
be applied to Mr. Lloyd George. So, with a gesture
of protest, Christabel said, "I think I need not
trouble him with any further questions."</p>

<p>After some questioning by Mrs. Pankhurst to which
Mr. Lloyd George returned the scantiest and most
surly of replies, Mrs. Drummond said earnestly but
with a touch of humour in her voice.</p>

<p>"I should like to ask Mr. Lloyd George this question;
many times he has refused to answer me.
When do you intend to put a stop to these things by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
giving us the vote?" Shrugging his shoulders, Mr.
Lloyd George turned to the Magistrate who gave
the desired reply: "That is not a question for the
witness." Mrs. Drummond added, after a pause,
quietly and reproachfully: "You and your colleagues
are much to blame for this agitation."
"You must not make a statement," said the Magistrate.
"You see, we never get a chance at other
times," said Mrs. Drummond appealingly. At this
Mr. George smiled broadly, but not very pleasantly,
and shaking his head said, "Indeed you do!" as he
left the box.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis Bennett now told Christabel that he
wished her to call Mr. Herbert Gladstone in order
that the Home Secretary might not be detained
from his duties in the House unnecessarily but she
declared that it was absolutely essential that she
should first call one other witness. Mr. Curtis
Bennett protested and she said, "I have only one
question to put to this lady." "Very well then, one
question," he said smiling as though he scarcely believed
her, and one could plainly see, determining
to hold her to her word. Christabel then called
"Miss Marie Brackenbury," who stepped quietly into
the box. Christabel gently asked her whether it were
true that she had suffered six weeks' imprisonment in
connexion with this agitation and as soon as she had
assented said quickly, but in a clear, penetrating
voice, "Did Mr. Horace Smith tell you in sentencing
you to that term he was doing what he was
told?" "You must not put that question!" almost
shouted the Magistrate. But the witness had
already replied, "He did." "The witness has said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
'yes,' upon oath," said Miss Pankhurst triumphantly
turning to the place where the Cabinet Ministers
sat. There was a strange stir in the court, those
present feeling that belief in the inviolability of British
Justice was slipping from their grasp. For a
moment or two there was an unpleasant pause and
Mr. Curtis Bennett sat flushed and angry.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, was
then called and took his place in the witness box.
With his shiny bald forehead, ruddy face, prominent
eyes and corpulent figure, he formed not only a striking
contrast to his colleague who had just been examined,
but was as far removed from the impressive
dignity of his own distinguished father. Altogether
his general appearance was that which the romantic
idealist would associate rather with a comfortable
and prosperous shopkeeper than with a Cabinet
Minister. As soon as he had been sworn, he placed
his elbows on the ledge in front of him and looked
smilingly around the court, as much as to say, "Nothing
of this kind can disturb me, I intend to enjoy
myself."</p>

<p>Miss Pankhurst began by endeavouring to fix upon
him as Home Secretary the responsibility for the
proceedings against herself and her colleagues which
he had denied in the House of Commons. She
succeeded in forcing him to admit, "I am at the
head of the responsible department." But when she
put the questions more plainly, saying, "Did you
not, as a matter of fact, instruct the Commissioner
of Police to take the present proceedings?" and
"Are the Government as a whole responsible for
these proceedings?" Mr. Muskett jumped up, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
each case, shouting, "I object to that!" and the
Magistrate also said that the questions could not be
answered.</p>

<p>They were also determined that no more unpleasant
disclosures were to be made, but she would
not leave the subject. "Did you instruct Mr.
Horace Smith to decide against Miss Brackenbury
and to send her to prison for six weeks?" she asked.
"You cannot put that question either," said Mr.
Curtis Bennett in a slightly raised tone. "It is a
pity that the public interest should suffer on that account,"
was her severe reply, and turning to Mr.
Gladstone, she said, "Did you offer any instructions
to Mr. Horace Smith?" "I object to this; it is
contempt of court to continue putting these questions!"
indignantly cried Mr. Muskett again springing
to his feet, but with a broad sweep of her hand
she declared, "The public will answer them." Then
turning to Mr. Gladstone, whose enjoyment of the
situation had now entirely vanished, she persisted,
"What do you suggest is the meaning of what Mr.
Horace Smith has said?" but again the Magistrate
intervened.</p>

<p>She next asked Mr. Gladstone to define the word
"rush." "I can hardly give any definition of it,
but a rush implies force," he said, growing more
comfortable again. "Do you deny that it involves
speed rather than force?" she asked, and he replied
smiling and putting his head knowingly on one side,
"Speed generally involves force." This argument
continued for some time. Then she asked:
"Were you anticipating that you would be in bodily
danger as a consequence of the issue of this Bill?"
"I did not think of it at all. I did not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
whether the possibility existed or not," he answered,
squaring his shoulders and throwing out his chest.
She waved her hand. "You are like us, above these
considerations. You were not in fear?" "No,
not at all," he answered, looking pleased with himself.
"Did you ever think that public property was
in danger as a consequence of this bill having been
issued?" "I thought it quite possible," he said a
little more seriously, "I thought there would be danger
from the crowds." "Then you were agreeably
disappointed on the morning of the 14th, when you
found no harm had been done?" "No, I was not.
The police measures were sufficient to stop any serious
accident or danger," he said proudly and magisterially.</p>

<p>She kept putting questions of this kind, first in
one form then in another until he began to grow
tired and puzzled, and was evidently in fear of making
some unwise admission. "Did you feel that
but for the line of police protecting you, the crowd
would have rushed upon you and attacked you?"
she asked at last with expressive emphasis. "The
police were not protecting me," he answered with an
air of offended dignity; "I felt no personal fear."
"Did any other person seem in danger of attack?"
"The police gave them very little chance." "What
made you think them a dangerous or hostile crowd?"
"Of course, I am quite accustomed to seeing these
crowds. I know what has happened before."
"What has happened?" "Disorderly scenes."
Mr. Gladstone was standing up now and looking
quite severe. "What harm have they done?"
"Very little, as it happened." "What harm have
they attempted to do?" "That is not for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
answer." "Have they attempted to do more than
secure an interview with the Prime Minister?"
Mr. Gladstone turned to the Magistrate, who said,
"That is not a question for him to answer."</p>

<p>"We will go back to the 13th," she said. "Do
you think anyone was obstructed in their passage to
the House of Commons?" "I cannot speak for
other people." "You saw no attempt to waylay
Members of Parliament or Cabinet Ministers?"
Her questions continued thick and fast. He admitted
that he had seen no one waylaid or injured
and no harm done, but took refuge in the assertion:
"There was a great crowd." "But a crowd assembles
when the King goes to open Parliament," she
said. He answered crossly, "Presumably, they
were waiting to 'rush' the House of Commons,"
and added later that he had heard that certain police
constables had been injured, and that there had
been thirty-seven arrests and over forty complaints
of losses of purses and watches. "Comparing
that with the net result of a Lord Mayor's Show
crowd or any sort of procession, really less harm resulted?"
she asked, but he gave no reply and her
questioning as to how many policemen were on duty
and what the cost had been to the country were suppressed
by Mr. Curtis Bennett.</p>

<p>Presently Christabel asked, "How do you define
a political offence?" Mr. Gladstone leant over the
edge of the box and smiled again. "I wish you
would give me a good definition," he said, in friendly
confidential tones, "I am often asked that question
in the House of Commons." "Well, with the
Magistrate's permission, I will," she answered.
"A political offence is one committed in connexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with political disturbances and with a political motive."
"I do not think that a sufficient explanation,"
he said with a challenging air. "If I am at
liberty after this day's proceedings are over, I shall
have pleasure in sending you a fuller account."
Then she asked, "Do you remember that when a
deputation of women went to the House of Commons
to see the Prime Minister, instead of being allowed
to enter, they were arrested?" "I have no
immediate recollection of that, only a general recollection,"
was the Home Secretary's reply given with a
lofty manner. When the question was put again in
a slightly different form, the Magistrate interrupted:
"That does not arise on the issue." "It throws a
light on it though," said Miss Pankhurst. "Please
do obey; otherwise I shall have to stop it altogether,"
said Mr. Curtis Bennett, and one heard a note of
regret in his voice. He evidently enjoyed the discomfort
of the Cabinet Ministers and the spectacle
of their professing blankest ignorance on well-known
points. "I have given you much more licence than
I should give Counsel," he urged.</p>

<p>"In the action we took on the 13th is it within
your knowledge that we were acting on advice given
by yourself?" Christabel asked. "I wish you
<i>would</i> take my advice," Mr. Gladstone answered.
"We are trying to take it," she said quietly.
"What did you mean when you said that men had
used <i>force majeure</i> in demanding the vote?" "If
you hand me the speech, I daresay I can tell you."</p>

<p>She held out a copy of it towards him but Mr.
Curtis Bennett interposed. "How is this material
to what Mr. Gladstone saw? You are cross-examining
your own witness, Miss Pankhurst, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
must not do that." "May I not ask any explanation
whatsoever as to the counsel given to us?" she
asked with a persuasive air. "No, you may not,"
the Magistrate replied sternly. "We never have
any opportunity. May I ask whether he made certain
statements?" Mr. Curtis Bennett smiled and
pretended not to notice, and Christabel eagerly
turned to Mr. Gladstone, reading from the printed
copy of his speech. "Did you say it was impossible
not to sympathise with the eagerness and passion
which have actuated so many women on this subject?"
"Yes," he replied. "Did you say men
had had to struggle for centuries for their political
rights?" "Yes." "Did you say that they had to
fight from the time of Cromwell and that for the last
130 years the warfare had been perpetual?" His
smile was growing broader and broader. "Yes,"
he said. "Did you say that on this question experience
showed that predominance of argument alone&mdash;and
you believed that that had been attained&mdash;was
not enough to win the political day? Did you
say that?" "Yes." "Did you say that we are in
the stage of what is called 'academic discussion,'
which serves for the ventilation of pious opinions
and is accompanied, you admit, by no effective action
on the part of the Government, or of political parties
or of voters throughout the country?" "Yes."
"Did you say that members of the House of Commons
reflect the opinion of the country, not only in
regard to the number of people outside, but in regard
to the intensity of the feeling in support of a
movement, and that the Government must necessarily
be a reflex of the party which brought it into
being?" "Yes." "Did you say this: 'There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
comes a time when political dynamics are far more
important than political arguments?' You said
that?" "Yes." "And that 'men had learned this
lesson?'" "Yes." "And that they know the
necessity for 'demonstrating that <i>force majeure</i>
which actuates and arms a Government for effective
work'?" "Yes, I think it was a most excellent
speech!" he said nodding his head and smiling up
at the prisoner evidently regarding the whole affair
as a very good joke. The court laughed too, but
for a different reason, and the Magistrate raised no
objection.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Christabel, smiling demurely,
"Did you say that this was the task before
the leaders of this great movement?" "Yes."
"Did you speak of people assembled in tens of
thousands in the 'thirties, 'sixties and 'eighties, and
do you know that we have done it in Hyde Park,
and on Woodhouse Moor and other places?"
"Yes." "Why don't you give us the vote then?"
she said with quick emphasis, and the court laughed
again. "Are you aware of the words your distinguished
father spoke on the matter?" she continued.
"I heard the quotation." "Do you assent to the
proposition he laid down?" "Yes." "Then you
cannot condemn our methods any more," she said
triumphantly. "That is hardly a matter for my
opinion," he said, suddenly remembering that he must
preserve his dignity. "It is a very interesting question,
though. I need not trouble you further," she
concluded.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Pankhurst rose and the witness turned
to her quite cheerfully. "I want to ask Mr. Gladstone,"
she said, "if he is aware that the consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of our being ordered to be bound over is that we
cannot consent and that we shall go to prison?"
"That is a matter of law, and not for the witness,"
interposed the Magistrate. "If that happens to us,
if we go to prison, I hope that Mr. Gladstone will
see that we go as political offenders," she said, but
again the Magistrate intervened. "Do you think
we should be likely to break the law if we had the
same means of representation as men?" she then
asked, and Mr. Gladstone replied with pompous
amiability. "I am sure your motive is excellent, but
that is a hypothetical question which I cannot answer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pankhurst was irritated. "I will ask Mr.
Gladstone," she said, "whether, in his opinion we
should be treated as ordinary criminals, searched,
stripped and put into cells as though we were drunkards
and pickpockets?" "You must not put that
question," said the Magistrate. The case amused
him, but he did not like the unpleasant side of it put
forward.</p>

<p>This concluded the evidence of the Cabinet Ministers,
and as they were about to leave the court,
Christabel graciously said, "May we tender our
warm thanks to these two gentlemen who have done
us the favour of coming forward to give evidence?"
She then called a number of witnesses in support of
her contention that the crowd on the night of the
13th was an orderly one and that no violence was
done. Amongst these were Colonel Massy, formerly
of the Sixth Dragoon Guards, Lady Constance
Lytton, and Mr. Nevinson, a well-known leader-writer,
and war correspondent. Mrs. May, another
witness, said that in her opinion the word "rush"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>had been used on the famous handbill in a sense similar
to that conveyed by the expression "A dash to
the North Pole," explaining, that though an attempt
to reach the North Pole is described as a "dash," it
is, in reality, the slowest possible mode of travel. In
the same way she imagined that the public had been
asked to "rush" the House of Commons into passing
a Votes for Women measure.</p>

<div id="Illus16" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="348" height="556" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mr. Herbert Gladstone in the witness-box being
examined by Miss Christabel Pankhurst, October, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then came Miss Evelyn Sharp, well known as
a writer of delightful stories for children, one of
those frail wan-faced little people, who, whilst looking
always as though a puff of strong wind would
carry them away, yet manage to accomplish such
quantities of work as fill the strongest with amaze,
and at the same time have ever ready a fund of the
brightest and cheeriest good humour. Now she told
in the funniest and most winning way, that she had
taken the fateful handbill as an invitation to go to
the House of Commons and, if possible, not to turn
back, and how, when she had found the police were
determined to bar the way up Victoria Street, she
had stooped and dodged between them in the middle
of a scene which she described as being "like a rush
at hockey."</p>

<p>Miss F. E. Macaulay, an historical student, then
gave several instances of women having gone to the
House of Commons for the purpose of presenting
petitions in ancient days and said she considered that
the Suffragettes were only reviving an ancient custom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the day had passed; the case had begun
at ten and it was now seven o'clock. Except
for half an hour at lunch time, there had been no interval
and during all these hours, but for an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
brief five minutes or so when Mrs. Pankhurst
or Mrs. Drummond had taken a turn, Christabel
had been constantly examining witnesses, remaining
always eager, alert, and full of energy and resource.
Several times she had applied for an adjournment,
but Mr. Curtis Bennett was just as anxious to tire
her out and thus finish the trial, as she was to prolong
it. At last, at half past seven, he asked how
many further witnesses she proposed to put into the
box. She replied, "About fifty. We are sorry to
take up the time of the court, but we are fighting for
our liberty." On hearing this, Mr. Curtis Bennett
decided to adjourn the hearing of the case until the
following Saturday, ordering that the defendants
should be released on bail as before.</p>

<p>So Christabel had won for the time being. Whatever
the final result might be the defendants had
three more days of freedom before them, and the
case which by the long accounts of it that were appearing
in every newspaper was interesting thousands
of people in the Votes for Women movement,
was to be carried on for another day. Criminal
cases, many of them dealing with the foulest and
most sordid crimes, are allowed to drag on for weeks
and even months, whilst public time, public money,
and public interest is lavishly expended upon them;
we felt that we need not scruple then to prolong, as
far as we possibly could, a trial dealing with great
political issues. Moreover, our second Albert Hall
meeting had been fixed for October 29th and we
hoped that the defendants might be free to speak
that night.</p>

<p>When Saturday morning at length came round
and the prisoners again took their places in the dock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
it was at once evident that Mr. Curtis Bennett was
determined to bring the case to an abrupt conclusion.
Speaking in sharper and harsher tones than any
we had heard from him before, he announced that
he had decided only to hear two or three more witnesses
whom the defendants might specially select,
unless there were others who could give evidence
relevant to the case in regard to a set of facts entirely
different from any that had been raised. As
this decision might take the defendants by surprise
he would allow an adjournment of half an hour
in which they might consider which of their witnesses
they would prefer to call. Requests to state what
class of evidence he would consider relevant, both
from Christabel and Mrs. Pankhurst, the Magistrate
met with a curt refusal to say anything further, and
Christabel was not in form to overcome his objections
as she had been on the previous days. Indeed
we now saw with anxiety that the excitement and
extra pressure of work of the last few weeks, coupled
with the constant heavy routine entailed by her position
in the Union and the great strain of conducting
this case, had begun to tell on her and, for the
first time in her life, we began to fear that she might
break down. But even now she would not abandon
the fight to prolong the case. It was impossible in
half an hour to examine individually the hundreds
of persons who had by this time offered to testify
as witnesses, in order to find out which of them
would prove most valuable to our case. The only
thing to be done was to choose a few, almost at random,
who possessed some special position or influence,
and whom we also knew personally to be particularly
sympathetic and observant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>When the half hour had elapsed and the prisoners
had again taken their places, Christabel first called
Mr. James Murray, the Liberal Member of Parliament
for East Aberdeenshire, who had so kindly
come to the rescue when bail had been refused at
Bow Street. He stepped into the box, a huge figure
immaculately dressed and faultlessly groomed, and
turned his big ruddy, good humoured face towards
the three prisoners with a kindly smile. When
asked by Christabel if he were present at the meeting
in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, October 11th,
he replied: "I was going into the National Gallery
and saw a collection of well dressed people in
the Square. I think your mother was speaking, but
I could not hear anything. What struck me was
that the crowd listening to her was composed of exactly
the type of people who go to Church on Sunday
in Scotland." "Then they must have been very
respectable," said Christabel. "Did you get a copy
of the Bill?" "No." "I daresay you saw it in
the papers?" "I saw a statement in the papers."
"How did you understand the word 'rush'?"
"I did not take the matter seriously at all." Here
Mr. Curtis Bennett interrupted curtly, "That really
is for me, Miss Pankhurst, as I have told you."
"Did you resolve to accept the invitation?" Christabel
asked. "I could not very well, you see," said
Mr. Murray smiling broadly, "because I was inside
the citadel." "He has the right of entry," said
Mr. Curtis Bennett with mock solemnity, and for the
first time that morning with a twinkle in his eyes.
"Were you near Westminster on the 13th?" was
the next question. "I was in the House and sitting
down to dinner when I got a telegram from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
mother sent from the neighbourhood of Bow Street,
asking me to go across there." "This cannot be
relevant," said Mr. Curtis Bennett sharply, but Mr.
Murray merely looked amused, and went on: "In
coming here I drove in a hansom up Parliament
Street. The whole place was like a besieged city
except that we had police officers instead of soldiers.
A little beyond Dover House the crowd was held
back by a cordon, but I had not the slightest difficulty
in getting through in a hansom. Afterwards
I returned to the House by the Strand, and the Embankment
and had very little trouble in getting
back." "Was it a disorderly crowd?" "No, I
think you could say an ordinary London crowd."</p>

<p>"Did you come to the conclusion that the persons
who had called the meeting had done so with a desire
to incite the crowd to disorder or damage?" It
was Mrs. Pankhurst who spoke now. "No," answered
Mr. Murray, "I thought that if it were for
any purpose at all it was to advertise the cause."
"You know something of the women who are conducting
this agitation?" was Mrs. Pankhurst's next
question, and Mr. Murray said gallantly: "Yes,
I have the greatest admiration for them; for their
earnestness of purpose, ability, and general management
of the whole scheme." "You know they have
tried every other political method?" "Yes, and if
they had been men instead of women they would not
have been in the dock now&mdash;judging by the past."
"Do you agree with Mr. Lloyd George when he
said that if the Government would give us what we
are asking for this agitation would cease?" "I
have no doubt it would. I go further than Mr.
Lloyd George and I say you are entitled to it," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the witness with fervour, and then, with a genial motion
of farewell to the prisoners he withdrew.</p>

<p>After Dr. Miller Macquire, the well known Army
coach, a stout little man with a black moustache and
a strong Irish brogue, and Miss Agnes Murphy, an
Australian, a quiet-voiced, pale-faced lady had also
given evidence, Mr. Curtis Bennett said that he
would hear no more witnesses. Every attempt to
overcome his decision failed and Christabel then applied
for an adjournment in order that she and her
companions might be in a position to do themselves
full justice when they addressed the court. Everyone
present anxiously hoped that this request would
be granted, for it was evident that the woman who
had hitherto conducted the defence so brilliantly,
was almost worn out. The Magistrate, however,
was determined to bring the case to an end, and he
said, "You have had a long time to take this matter
into consideration, you must either address me now,
or not at all." She protested that the case was being
"<i>rushed</i>" through the court, and at this there
was laughter and applause, for everyone recognised
the play on the word "rush." But Mr. Curtis Bennett
said hotly, "Are you going to address me or
not?" With a gesture of protest, Christabel Pankhurst
then began to speak in her own defence. She
held in her hand a sheaf of type-written notes, containing
dates and quotations, but every word of her
brilliant speech was extemporised. She spoke
quickly, and with a passionate emotion which is usually
foreign to her. When she referred to the nature
of the prosecution and to the conduct of the
Government in having denied the women the trial by
jury to which the nature of their alleged defence entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
them and in having preferred to hustle their
case through the police court where the drunkards
and pickpockets are tried, it was with a thrill of indignation
that spread through the court.</p>

<p>She began by declaring that these proceedings had
been taken "out of malice and for vexation," and
"in order to lame, in an illegitimate way, a political
enemy." In proof of this she cited the attitude of
the Government towards the present women's movement
from its very beginning three years before.
She drew attention to the fact, which had been sworn
to in the witness box, that Mr. Horace Smith had
allowed himself to be coerced by the Government
into settling, in conjunction with them, whether a
certain lady charged in connection with this agitation,
was guilty, and even the term of imprisonment which
was to be inflicted upon her before the evidence had
been heard.</p>

<p>"Now, this policy of the Government of weighting
the scales against us," Christabel declared, "is
not of interest merely to us, but to the whole community.
In the course of British history we have
seen many struggles for the purification of our judicial
system.... It has been left to the
twentieth century&mdash;to these so-called democratic
days&mdash;to see our judicial system corrupted for party
ends. I am glad that we have been able to perform
the public duty and service of doing something to
attack this evil while it is in the bud...."</p>

<p>Dealing with the form of the summons, she urged
that, if she and her colleagues were guilty of any
offence, it was that of illegal assembly, but the
Government had not charged them with this offence,
because they had wished to keep their trial in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
police court and to prevent it from coming before a
jury. "They believe, that by this means," she said,
"they will succeed in prejudicing the public against
us. We know perfectly well that up till recently
the general public shunned the police court as a disgraceful
place. Well, I think that by our presence
here we have done something to relieve the police
court of that unenviable reputation. We have done
something to raise its status in the public eye."</p>

<p>"The authorities dare not see this case come before
a jury," she continued, "because they knew perfectly
well that if it were heard before a jury of
our countrymen we should be acquitted, just as John
Burns was acquitted years ago for taking action far
more serious, far more dangerous to the public peace
than anything we have done. Yes, I say they are
afraid of sending us before a jury, and I am quite
sure that this will be obvious to the public, and that
the Government will suffer from the underhand, the
unworthy and the disgraceful subterfuge by which
they have removed this case to what we can only call
a Star Chamber of the twentieth century. Yes, this
is a Star Chamber.... We are deprived of
trial by jury. We are also deprived of the right
of appeal against the magistrate's decision. Very,
very carefully has this procedure been thought out;
very, very cunningly has it been thought to hedge us
in on every side, and to deprive us of our rights in
the matter! Though we are rendered liable to six
months' imprisonment, we are yet denied the privileges
in making our defence that people liable to
three months' imprisonment enjoy. We shall be
told in the House of Commons no doubt&mdash;we have
been told the same thing before now&mdash;that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
only bound over, we need not go to prison, if we go
to prison we have only ourselves to thank....
If the case is decided against us, if we are called
upon to be bound over, it must be remembered that
that amounts to imprisoning us, and that therefore
the authorities cannot possibly escape their responsibility
in sending us to prison by saying that we could
be at liberty if we liked. Magna Charta has been
practically torn up by the present Government....
We consider that it is not we who ought
to be in the dock to-day, but the people who are responsible
for such a monstrous state of affairs."</p>

<p>Then she went on to deal with the reasons for
issuing the bill: "We do not deny at all that we
issued this bill; none of us three have wished to deny
responsibility. We did issue the bill; we did cause
it to be circulated; we did put upon it the words
'Come and help the Suffragettes to rush the House of
Commons.' For these words we do not apologise....
It is very well known that we took this
action in order to press forward a claim, which, according
to the British Constitution, we are well entitled
to make. After all, we are seeking only to
enforce the observance of the law of the land that
taxation and representation must go together, and
that one who obeys the laws must have a share in
making them. Therefore, when we claim the Parliamentary
vote, we are asking the Government to
abandon the illegal practice of denying representation
to those who have a perfect right to it."</p>

<p>"I want here to insist," she said, "upon the legality
of the action which we have taken. We have a
perfectly constitutional right to go ourselves in person
to lay our grievances before the House of Commons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and as one witness&mdash;an expert student of
history&mdash;pointed out to you, we are but pursuing a
legitimate course which in the old days women pursued
without the smallest interference by the authorities."</p>

<p>In regard to the meaning of the word "rush," she
pointed out that a large number of witnesses had
been examined, and that all these witnesses had testified
that, according to their interpretation of the
word "rush," no violence was counselled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The word 'rush,'" Christabel said, "appears to be very
much the rage just now. We find that at a meeting of the
League for the Preservation of Swiss Scenery, Mr. Richard
Whiteing, discussing the question of Swiss railways, suggested
that a general 'rush' to the Italian Alps might induce
the Swiss to listen to reason. Well, I do not think that
anyone here would suggest that Mr. Whiteing meant to
offer any violence to the Swiss in his use of the word 'rush.'
He meant to imply that a speedy advance should be made
to the Italian Alps. Then we have Mr. McKinnon Wood
counselling the electors to 'rush' the County Council, and
get a lady elected to that body."</p>

<p>"I want to submit that 'rush' as a transitive verb cannot
mean 'attack,' 'assail,' 'make a raid upon,' or anything
of that kind."</p>
</div>

<p>In support of her contentions, Christabel quoted
the definitions given by many dictionaries, including
<i>The Century Dictionary</i>, <i>Chambers' English Dictionary</i>,
and <i>Farmer and Henley's Dictionary of Slang</i>
which gave amongst other meanings of the word
"rush" "an eager demand," "urgent pressure of
business," "hurry or hasten,&mdash;it may be unduly,"
"to go forward over hastily; for example a number
of Bills are 'rushed' through Parliament or a case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
'rushed' through a law court." One of the definitions
ran, "A 'rusher,' a go-ahead person," whilst
"on the rush" was said to mean "in a hurry," and
"with a rush, with spirit or energetically."</p>

<p>Christabel also displayed a little label which had
been sent to her during the progress of the case. It
stated, "Rush by first train leaving," and was used
in America for parcels required to reach their destination
early. She reminded the magistrate of Mrs.
May's comparison of the phrase "rush the House
of Commons" with "a dash for the Pole," saying:</p>

<p>"Everyone knows that you cannot get to the Pole
in a hurry, but you can try to get there in a hurry,
and that is what 'a dash to the Pole' means.
Everyone knows that with a timid Government like
the present, having at its service the entire Metropolitan
Police Force, if one woman says she is going
to rush the House of Commons, there will be an
immense number of police to prevent her doing it.
Nobody, then, having regard to the facts I have
mentioned, thought the women would rush the
House of Commons, but they knew that the women
would be there to show their indignation against the
Government, and I am glad to say that they were
there. It may mean six months' imprisonment, but
I think it is worth it."</p>

<p>"We are anxious to know by what statute it is
illegal to go to the House of Commons, walk up the
steps and make our way to the Strangers' Entrance?
We should like to know whether that is an illegal
thing to do, and, if it is not illegal to go at a slow
pace, we should like to know whether it is illegal to
go at a quick pace, because that is what the word
'rush' means. 'To rush the House of Commons'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
is to go with all possible speed inside the House of
Commons, and I hope that we shall be told what
statute we have contravened by doing it ourselves,
or by sending or inviting others to do it."</p>

<p>Miss Pankhurst next referred to the speeches
made in Trafalgar Square on October 11th. She
was glad that the prosecution had raised this point
because it was all in the defendant's favor. The
speeches made at that meeting were made in interpretation
of the famous handbill and all the witnesses
who had heard those speeches, not excepting
Mr. Lloyd George himself, were agreed that they
contained nothing inflammatory and no incitement
to violence whatsoever. Christabel continued:</p>

<p>"It is not because of anything serious that occurred
on October 13th, or was expected to occur,
that we are here; we are here in order that we may
be kept out of the way for some months, and may
cease from troubling the Government for as long a
period as they can find it in them, or for which the
public will allow them, to deprive us of our liberty."</p>

<p>Whilst hosts of witnesses had testified to the
orderly character of the crowd, she pointed out that
two police officers only had been put forward on the
other side. The prosecution had been unable to
bring forward a single impartial person. But police
evidence appeared to be all that was considered in
the Police Court, and she cried out passionately:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It seems to me that the Prosecution, the witnesses, the
authorities, the magistrates, are all on one side, they are all
in the same box, and the prisoner charged with an offence
is absolutely helpless whatever facts he may bring forward.
It is indeed a waste of time to bring evidence. Over the
doors of this court ought to be the motto, "Abandon hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
all ye who enter here." We do not care for ourselves, because
imprisonment is nothing to us; but when we think of
the thousands of helpless creatures who come into this monstrous
place with nobody to help them, nobody to plead for
them, and we know perfectly well that they are found guilty
before they have a chance of defending themselves, the injustice
that is done in these courts is almost too terrible to
contemplate.</p>
</div>

<p>We saw then those helpless creatures, as we had
done so often, and as Christabel called up their image,
her voice broke and there were tears on her face.
"I am thankful to think," she said triumphantly,
"that we have been able, by submitting ourselves to
the absurd proceedings that are conducted here, to
ventilate this fearful wrong."</p>

<p>Christabel next developed the contention that in
the course which they had taken the women had followed
historical precedent and had been encouraged
by statesmen and especially by Liberal statesmen.
The Reform Acts had been obtained by disorder.
Prior to 1832, the Mansion House, the Custom
House, the Bishop's Palace, the Excise Office, three
prisons, four toll-houses, and forty-two private
dwellings and warehouses had been burnt. Amongst
other things, the breaking-down of the Hyde Park
railings won the Reform Act of 1867. In 1884
there were the Aston Park riots. John Bright
threatened to crowd the streets from Westminster
Bridge to Charing Cross. Lord Randolph Churchill
advised the voters of Ulster&mdash;and voters have
other means of urging their opinions&mdash;to resort
"to the supreme arbitrament of force." He said,
"Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right," and as
a result of his words dangerous riots almost amounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to warfare occurred, yet he was never prosecuted.
Joseph Chamberlain threatened to march one hundred
thousand men on London, but no proceedings
were taken against him. "The Gladstone of those
days," Christabel declared, "was less absurd, hesitating,
and cowardly than the present Gladstone and
his colleagues, and therefore he took the statesmanlike
action of pressing forward the Reform Bill instead
of taking proceedings against Mr. Chamberlain.
Even a vote of censure moved upon Mr.
Chamberlain in the House of Commons, was defeated."
John Burns, whose language was far more
violent than any that the women had used, was tried
at the Old Bailey and acquitted. He said in his
speech that he was a rebel, because he was an outlaw.
Well, that fact will support us in all we have
done. If we go to far greater lengths than we have
done yet, we shall only be following in the footsteps
of a man who is now a member of the Government.
Following out this line of thought, Christabel went
on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Mr. Herbert Gladstone has told us in the speech I read
to him that the victory of argument alone is not enough.
As we cannot hope to win by force of argument alone, it is
necessary to overcome the savage resistance of the Government
to our claim for citizenship by other means. He says:
"Go on. Fight as the men did." And then, when we
show our power and get the people to help us, he takes proceedings
against us in a manner which would have been disgraceful
even in the old days of coercion, and which would
be thought disgraceful if it were practised in Russia.</p>

<p>Then there is Mr. Lloyd George, who, if any man has
done so, has set us an example. His whole career has been
a series of revolts.... He has said that if we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
get the vote&mdash;mark these words&mdash;we should be justified
in adopting the methods which men had to adopt, namely,
in pulling down the Hyde Park railings.</p>

<p>Then, as a sign of the way in which men politicians deal
with men's interests, we have heard Lord Morley saying:
"We are in India in the presence of a living movement,
and a movement for what? For objects which we ourselves
have taught them to think are desirable objects, and unless
we can somehow reconcile order with satisfaction of those
ideas and aspirations, the fault will not be theirs; it will be
ours&mdash;it will mark the breakdown of British statesmanship."
Apply those words to our case. Remember that we
are demanding of Liberal statesmen that which for us
is the greatest boon and the most essential right. Remember
that we are asking for votes, that we are demanding
the franchise, and if the present Government cannot reconcile
order with our demand for the vote without delay, it
will mark the breakdown of their statesmanship. Yes, their
statesmanship has broken down already. They are disgraced.
It is only in this Court that they have the smallest
hope of getting bolstered up.</p>
</div>

<p>Turning finally from the Magistrate to the great
world of public opinion outside, she finished on a
defiant note, caring nothing whether the abuse which
she had heaped upon his petty court and its unworthy
procedure should cause him to increase her sentence
ten or even a hundred fold. Mr. Curtis Bennett sat
with brows knit and an angry flush on his face, and
the whole court was wrought up to the most intense
excitement. But now it was Mrs. Pankhurst's turn
to speak and her clear even tones and absolute calm
of manner created if possible an even deeper impression.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sir, I want to endorse what my daughter has said, that
in my opinion we are proceeded against in this Court by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
malice on the part of the Government. [She began quietly
and firmly.] I want to protest as strongly as she has done.
I want to put before you that the very nature of your duties
in this Court&mdash;although I wish to say nothing disrespectful
to you&mdash;render you unfitted to deal with a question
which is a political question, as a body of jurymen could do.
We are not women who would come into this court as
ordinary law-breakers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Drummond here is a woman of very great public
spirit; she is an admirable wife and mother; she has very
great business ability, and, although a married woman, she
has maintained herself for many years, and has acquired
for herself the admiration and respect of all the people with
whom she has had business relations. I do not think I
need speak about my daughter. Her abilities and earnestness
of purpose are very well known to you. They are
young women. I am not, Sir. You and I are older, and
have both had very great and very wide experience of life
under different conditions. Before you decide what is to
be done with us, I should like you to hear from me a statement
of what has brought me into this dock this morning.</p>

<p>I was brought up by a father who taught me that his
children, boys and girls alike, had a duty towards their country;
they must be good citizens. I married a man, whose
wife I was, but also his comrade in all his public life. He
was, as you know, a distinguished member of your own
profession, but he felt it his duty, in addition, to do political
work, to interest himself in the welfare of his fellow countrymen
and countrywomen. Throughout the whole of my
marriage I was associated with him in his public work. In
addition to that, as soon as my children were of an age to
permit me to leave them, I took to public duties. I was
for many years a Guardian of the Poor. For many years
I was a member of the School Board, and when that was
abolished I was elected to the Educational Committee. My
experience in doing that work brought me in contact with
many of my own sex, who, in my opinion, found themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in deplorable positions because of the state of the English
law as it affects women. You in this court must have had
experience of women who would never have come here if
married women were afforded by law that claim for maintenance
by their husbands which I think in justice should
be given them when they give up their economic independence
and are unable to earn a subsistence for themselves.
You know how inadequate are the marriage laws to women.
You must know, Sir, as I have found out in my experience
of public life, how abominable, atrocious, and unjust are
the divorce laws as they affect women. You know very
well that the married woman has no legal right to the
guardianship of her children. Then, too, the illegitimacy
laws; you know that a woman sometimes commits the dreadful
crime of infanticide, while her partner, the man, who
should share her punishment, gets off scot free.</p>

<p>Ever since my girlhood, a period of about thirty years, I
have belonged to organisations to secure for women that
political power which I have felt essential to bringing about
those reforms which women need. We have tried to be
what you call womanly, we have tried to use "feminine influence,"
and we have seen that it is of no use. Men who
have been impatient have invariably got reforms.</p>

<p>I have seen that men are encouraged by law to take advantage
of the helplessness of women. Many women have
thought as I have and for many, many years have tried by
that influence of which we have so often been reminded to
alter these laws, but have found that that influence counts
for nothing. When we went to the House of Commons
we used to be told, when we were persistent, that Members
of Parliament were not responsible to women, they were
responsible only to voters, and that their time was too fully
occupied to reform those laws, although they agreed that
they needed reforming.</p>

<p>We women have presented larger petitions in support of
our enfranchisement than were ever presented for any other
reform, we have succeeded in holding greater public meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
than men have ever held for any reform, in spite of
the difficulty which women have in throwing off their natural
diffidence, that desire to escape publicity which we have
inherited from generations of our foremothers; we have
broken through that. We have faced hostile mobs at street
corners, because we were told that we could not have that
representation for our taxes which men have won unless we
converted the whole of the country to our side. Because
we have done this, we have been misrepresented, we have
been ridiculed, we have had contempt poured upon us, and
the ignorant mob incited to offer us violence, which we have
faced unarmed and unprotected by the safeguards which
Cabinet Ministers have.</p>

<p>I am here to take upon myself now, Sir, as I wish the
Prosecution had put upon me, the full responsibility for
this agitation in its present phase. I want to address you
as a woman who has performed the duties of a woman,
and, in addition, has performed the duties which ordinary
men have to perform, by earning a living for her children,
and educating them.</p>

<p>I want to make you realise that it is a point of honour
that if you decide&mdash;as I hope you will not decide&mdash;to
bind us over, that we shall not sign any undertaking, as
the Member of Parliament did who was before you yesterday.
Perhaps his reason for signing that undertaking may
have been that the Prime Minister had given some assurance
to the people he claimed to represent that something should
be done for them. We have had no such assurance. So,
Sir, if you decide against us to-day, to prison we must go,
because we feel that we should be going back to the hopeless
condition this movement was in three years ago if we
consented to be bound over to keep the peace which we have
never broken. If you decide to bind us over, although the
Government have admitted that we are political offenders,
we shall be treated as pickpockets and drunkards and I want
you, if you can, as a man, to realise what that means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
women like us. We are driven to do this, we are determined
to go on with this agitation, because we feel in honour
bound. Just as it was the duty of your forefathers, it is
our duty to make this world a better place for women than
it is to-day.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, we have not wished to waste your time in any
way; we have wished to make you realise that there is another
side to the case than that put before you by the
Prosecution. We want you to use your power&mdash;I do not
know what value there is in the legal claims that have been
put before you as to your power to decide this case&mdash;but
we want you, Sir, if you will, to send us to be tried in some
place more suitable for the trial of political offenders than
an ordinary police court. You must realise how futile it
is to attempt to settle this question by binding us over to
keep the peace. You have tried it; it has failed. Others
have tried to do it, and have failed. If you had power to
send us to prison, not for six months, but for six years,
for sixteen years, or for the whole of our lives, the Government
must not think that they could stop this agitation. It
would go on.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to draw your attention to the self-restraint
which was shown by our followers on the night of the 13th,
after we had been arrested. It only shows that our influence
over them is very great, because I think if they had
yielded to their natural impulses, there might have been a
breach of the peace. They were very indignant, but our
words have always been, be patient, exercise self-restraint,
show our so-called superiors that the criticism of women
being hysterical is not true; use no violence, offer yourselves
to the violence of others. We are going to win.
Our women have taken that advice; if we are in prison
they will continue to take that advice.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, that is all I have to say to you. We are here,
not because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts
to become law-makers.</p>

</div>

<p>The angry red had faded from Mr. Curtis Bennett's
face, and whilst Mrs. Pankhurst was speaking
he kept his hand up to it, and at one point we saw
it quiver and for a moment he hid his eyes. Some
of the big burly policemen whom we knew so well
and who, except in the "raids," when they were
obliged to do their duty, were always so kind and
jovial towards us, were openly in tears. Then Mrs.
Drummond, looking paler and more serious than is
her wont, rose up to speak in her turn. Her voice
was a few notes thinner and higher pitched and like
her words, it seemed to be stripped of all emotion
and to be instinct with the clearest and most logical
commonsense. Not only what she said, but her
whole personality was so honest, sincere and unaffected
that she seemed to add the one thing lacking
to the completeness of that presentment of the
great unanswerable case for Woman's Suffrage.
Her concluding words were an assurance that the
agitation, which was spreading and growing all over
the country, would go on as before. "I can speak
on good authority," she said, "for we have left
everything in working order and we shall find the
movement stronger than when we left it because the
action which the Government have taken has fired
the bosoms of women, who are determined to take
up the flag that we have had to lay down to-day."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Drummond had finished, Mr. Curtis
Bennett began speaking quite cheerfully and as
though the whole affair were an amusing discussion
between friends and had no unpleasant side to it.
During the first part of his speech he reviewed the
arguments on both sides of the case, and as he referred
meanwhile to the pages on which he had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
his notes he so frequently smiled as though they recalled
amusing and rather pleasant memories to him,
that many people made up their minds that he was
either about to state a case for a higher court, as the
defendants wished, or to discharge them altogether.
All at once, however, his tone changed and he began
to speak hurriedly, with lowered voice and increased
severity of manner, and went on to say that
there could be no doubt that it was for that court
and that court alone to deal with the offence for
which the defendants had been summoned; and that
there could be no doubt but that the handbill which
the defendants circulated was liable to cause something
to occur which might and probably would, end
in a breach of the peace. The Chief Commissioner
of Police was bound to keep Parliament Square and
the vicinity free and open, and the Commissioner of
Police had felt that it would be impossible to do that
if crowds assembled together in order to help and to
see the women "rush" the House of Commons.
Therefore each of the two older defendants would
be bound over in their own recognisances of £100,
and, they must find two sureties in £50 each to keep
the peace for twelve months, or in default must
undergo three months' imprisonment. In the case
of the younger defendant, her own recognisances
would be £50, with two sureties of £25 each, the alternative
being ten weeks' imprisonment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="no-indent center"><span class="smcap">The Trial of Mrs. Baines. The Mutiny in Holloway.
The Taking-down of the Grille.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Mrs. Drummond was right, for though she and
her companions had left a great blank in the work
of the Union, as she had predicted at the dock at
Bow Street, other women eagerly volunteered to
raise up the flag that they had been compelled to lay
down. In addition to the newcomers, every member
of the staff cheerfully undertook some extra task,
and the movement grew like a living flame. The
office at Clement's Inn was indeed fortunate in its
abundance of willing and able workers. Beside
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and her husband, and
charming Mrs. Tuke, Mrs. Pankhurst's co-secretary,
there were a host of others, amongst them dignified,
business-like Miss Kerr, with her rosy face and
pretty white hair, thoughtful, reliable Miss Hambling,
Mrs. Drummond's secretary, and Mrs. Sanders,
who, though financial secretary, was now finding
time to keep a list of Cabinet Minister's engagements
for us. There was also Jessie, the London
organiser, earnest and serious like all the Kenneys,
who, showing a grasp of the political situation and
an organising capacity indeed remarkable in a girl
of twenty-two, marshalled the force of women to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
ask of members of the Government those constant
questions.</p>

<p>The very greatest difficulty was now experienced
in getting into Cabinet Ministers' meetings, for
women were now almost entirely excluded. The expedient
of issuing a limited number of special
women's tickets, the recipients of which were obliged
to sign both name and address to a pledge neither to
disturb the meeting nor to transfer the ticket, was
first resorted to for Mr. Haldane's meeting at Sheffield,
on November 20th, 1907. The practice had
now become general and in some cases the women's
tickets had also to be countersigned by a Liberal official
to whom the applicants were personally known.
But in spite of such precautions the Suffragettes frequently
still succeeded in getting into the meetings
and that without having given any promise, and
when they could not get inside, they invariably raised
a protest in the street.</p>

<p>When Cabinet Ministers, cast as they were in unheroic
mould, discarded, to a large extent, the custom
of delivering their pronouncements to great
public gatherings where all might come, and instead
frequently made their weighty utterances at bazaars,
private or semi-private banquets and receptions and
meetings of a few tried and trusted friends, the Suffragettes
were always there even though the world
and Mrs. Grundy might be shocked. On November
5th, for instance, a well-known Liberal hostess, Mrs.
Godfrey Benson, gave a reception in honour of the
Prime Minister. As they stood together at the head
of the stairs receiving the guests, there came amongst
the ladies and gentlemen in evening dress, streaming
upward towards them, one strikingly tall and handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
lady in white satin with abundant dark hair,
who said as she took the Prime Minister by the
hand, "Can I do anything to persuade you to give
votes to women?" Then, still holding his hand in
hers, she proceeded to read out to him some clauses
of Magna Charta, explaining that these had been
intended to apply to women as well as to men. Mrs.
Godfrey Benson did not for some moments notice
Mr. Asquith's dilemma, but as soon as she did so,
she seized a police whistle which was attached to a
ribbon at her waist, and, by blowing loudly, summoned
an officer of the law, who conducted the lady
out of the house.</p>

<p>Very great precautions were taken to prevent the
Suffragettes approaching Mr. Asquith when he visited
Leeds to speak at the Coliseum on the afternoon
of Saturday, October 10th. From 7 o'clock in the
morning the police had been massed around the hall
and cordons, both of foot and mounted men were
drawn up outside the railway station and along the
road by which the Prime Minister was to pass. But,
in spite of all the force to guard him, as Mr. Asquith
emerged, Mrs. Baines, a little fragile figure, with
face ashen white and dark, blazing eyes, a creature
compounded of zeal and passion, threw herself in
front of him, crying, "Votes for Women, and down
with tyranny!" and the crowd cheered her, though
she was at once rudely hurled aside by the police.
Then, followed by thousands of people, she made
her way to Cockridge Street outside the Coliseum,
where she had already announced that she would
hold an open air meeting simultaneously with that of
Mr. Asquith, inside. A great crowd had gathered
there to hear her and when she put to them a resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
that she and her Suffragette comrades should
go to the Coliseum to demand an interview with the
Prime Minister, a forest of hands shot up in favour.
Then declaring, "If these tyrants won't come to us,
we must go to them and compel a hearing," she
jumped down from the carriage which had served
her as a platform, and, followed by a number of
other women and more slowly by the crowd itself,
she moved on towards the Coliseum. Half way
across the road the police barred the way and an
inspector asked her where she was going. "Don't
be foolish, Mrs. Baines," he said when she told him,
but she was not to be deterred and, running round
one of the mounted police, was arrested by a constable
on foot. The other women still pressed forward
and one by one five of them were arrested and
taken to the Town Hall, where they were charged
with disorderly conduct, whilst Mr. Asquith left the
meeting by a back exit amid the hisses and groans
of the crowd.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the others were each sent to
prison for five days on refusing to be bound over to
keep the peace, but the case against Mrs. Baines was
held over until the following Wednesday. She was
then charged with inciting to riot and unlawful assembly.
Her case was to be held over until the
Assizes, in November, and the opportunity of being
tried by Judge and Jury which Mrs. Pankhurst,
Christabel Pankhurst, and Mrs. Drummond had
claimed in vain was thus to fall to her lot. The
Grand Jury, having returned a True Bill against
Mrs. Baines, Mr. Pethick Lawrence, who was defending
her, served subp&#339;nas to give evidence at
the trial upon Mr. Asquith and Mr. Herbert Gladstone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
but the Cabinet Ministers had no intention of
allowing themselves to be examined by the Suffragettes
and to be made into a Suffragette advertisement
a second time. They applied to the Divisional
Court for a Rule to set aside the subp&#339;nas, and did
not scruple to take advantage of their position as
members of the Government to employ both the Attorney
General, Sir William Robson, K. C., and the
Solicitor General, Sir Samuel Evans, K. C., to plead
their case in opposition to Mr. Pethick Lawrence.
Though no precedent for setting aside a subp&#339;na in
criminal cases could be found, it was decided that
neither Mr. Asquith nor Mr. Gladstone should be
called upon to give evidence.</p>

<p>On Thursday and Friday, November 19th and
20th, the actual trial took place in the Leeds Town
Hall. Mrs. Baines freely admitted that she had
used the words, "if these tyrants will not come to
us, we must go to them and compel a hearing," and
that her intention had been to get into the meeting
and secure an interview with the Prime Minister,
but she protested that she had had no intention of
injuring him or anyone and when Mr. Bairstow, K.
C., the Counsel for the prosecution, asked if she had
carried any weapons, she replied, "Oh, my tongue
is weapon enough!" When asked to give an account
of her life, she said that she was the daughter of a
working man and had begun to help in earning the
family living at eleven years of age. After her
marriage she had continued to be a wage-earner,
though she was the mother of five children, because
her husband, who was a shoemaker, was only able
to earn 25 shillings a week. Nevertheless she had
done much public and social work as she had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Salvation Army lieutenant, an evangelist to a working-men's
mission, a member of the Stockport unemployed
committee and committee for the feeding
of school children, and a worker in the temperance
cause. When asked to give some account of her
speech to the crowd on the 10th of October, she said,
"I wanted the men and women of Leeds to understand
why we were there to protest against Mr.
Asquith's refusal to give us the vote. I said that
that afternoon Mr. Asquith would be dealing with
the Licensing question; that this was more a
woman's question than it was a man's, because we
women suffered most through intemperance, and
that no real temperance reform would ever be
brought about until women had a voice in the matter.
The unemployed question was also more a woman's
question than it was a man's, because it was the
women who really suffered most. Mr. Asquith had
never known what it was, as I have done, to go
without food or to go to school hungry. We
wanted to see Mr. Asquith and we wanted to know
when we were going to have access to Mr. Asquith."</p>

<p>After the evidence on both sides had been heard
Mr. Lawrence made an eloquent speech for the defence,
but it was nevertheless decided that Mrs.
Baines was guilty of unlawful assembly. The Judge
then asked her to enter into her own recognisances
to be of good behaviour, explaining that if she
agreed she would merely be promising not to use
violence or to incite to violence in future. Mrs.
Baines steadfastly maintained that she had had no
intention of using violence, but felt that she could
not conscientiously agree to be bound over to keep
the peace. Mr. Justice Pickford then said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
though he was reluctant to do so, he must pass sentence
upon her and ordered that she should be imprisoned
for six weeks in the Second Division. In
the result, however, she was only kept in prison for
three weeks because, though she had gone free meanwhile,
the fortnight during which she had awaited
her trial at the Assizes was counted as part of her
sentence, and in addition she was entitled to one
week's remission of sentence for good behaviour.</p>

<p>Amid all the whirl of militancy that had been
going on the work of educative peaceful propaganda
was never allowed to flag and beside the hundreds
of uncounted smaller meetings a series of great indoor
demonstrations calling for votes for women
and the release of the prisoners was held in the
Free Trade Hall, Manchester, the Town Hall,
Birmingham, the St. George's Hall, Bradford, the
Guild Hall, Plymouth, the Town Hall, Huddersfield,
the Town Hall, Battersea, the Town Hall,
Chelsea, the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, and in
many other places, and culminated in a second great
demonstration in the Albert Hall on October 29th
at which £3,000 was collected. Then, in declaring
the £20,000 campaign fund to be complete, Mrs.
Pethick Lawrence appealed for it to be carried on
to £50,000, and that the half way house of £25,000
should be reached before the founder of the Union
should be released from prison.</p>

<p>Whilst the W. S. P. U. had been thus active, the
Women's Freedom League had startled London by
a cleverly organised and smartly executed demonstration
in the Ladies' Gallery of the House of
Commons, on October 28th. That morning all the
world had awakened to find that little placards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
headed "A Proclamation containing a demand for
Votes for Women," had been posted on every
hoarding. At 8:30 in the evening, whilst Parliament
was discussing the Licensing Bill, and Mr.
Remnant, one of the Conservative Members, was
speaking, a woman in the Ladies' Gallery suddenly
thrust through the brass grille one of these proclamations
with a cry of "Votes for Women!" Instantly
Miss Muriel Matters darted to the front of
the Gallery and proceeded to deliver a Suffrage
speech, two attendants at once came rushing in,
tumbling over the ladies' trains and pushing unceremoniously
past them in haste to drag her from her
place, only to find that they could not do so, for,
by means of a padlock and chain around her waist,
she had attached herself to the grille. Whilst some
of the men struggled to break the chains, others
gagged her by holding their hands over her mouth,
but a second woman, also chained, took up the tale
with "we demand the vote," and, after she had
been stifled in the same impromptu and objectionable
fashion, a third cried, "We have remained behind
this insulting grille too long."</p>

<p>Members of Parliament were meanwhile pouring
into the House to see the show, and though Mr.
Remnant spoke on without pausing, but little notice
was taken of anything that he said. The attendants
in the Gallery now discovered that the chains around
the women's waists had been wrapped in wool to
prevent their clanking and were secured by strong
Yale padlocks, that, on being snapped together, had
locked automatically without a key, and after vainly
dragging and pulling at the women (who, in spite
of the gagging, still managed to articulate a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
or two occasionally), and after tugging again and
again at both locks and chains, the men came to the
conclusion that it would be necessary to remove
bodily those parts of the grille to which the three disturbers
were attached. Then all the women in the
Gallery, Suffragettes, Suffragists and even anti-Suffragists
were alike quickly bundled out. Next
screwdrivers were brought and the attendants set to
work to dismember the grille, and when this had
been done the women and the great pieces of
wrought brass work, to which they were still attached,
were hauled out by the attendants and taken
to Committee Room 15, where they were kept until a
smith arrived to file through the chains.</p>

<p>By this time the House had resumed its ordinary,
humdrum appearance, and the Members who had
come in during the disturbance had all drifted away,
but, as the Division bell rang and they came trooping
back to vote, a man in the Strangers' Gallery
shouted, "Why don't you do justice to women?"
and was dragged out by a number of policemen,
and within ten minutes afterwards a second man
shouted, "Why don't you give votes to women?"
and flung a shower of leaflets down amongst the
Members.</p>

<p>At the same time several women were attempting
to hold a meeting in the Lobby. The police flung
them outside but they immediately climbed up to
speak from the pedestal of the Richard C&#339;ur de
Lion statue, and whilst the constables clambered up
after them, pulled them down and placed them under
arrest, other Suffragettes made dash after dash to
re-enter the House. Crowds quickly gathered and
the confusion grew and fourteen women and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>man had been taken into custody before the people
were dispersed.</p>

<div id="Illus18" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="358" height="572" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mrs. Pankhurst in Prison</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next morning the prisoners were brought up at
the Westminster Police Court before Mr. Hopkins.
The first to be charged was Mr. Arnold Cutler,
the man who had been arrested in the fray, and
it was alleged that he had protested against the action
of the police, crying, "Shame! Leave the
Women alone!" and that when dragged away he
had taken off his belt and "assumed a threatening
attitude." He was fined 25 shillings. The women
were more heavily punished, being each fined £5,
and on refusing to pay were sent to Holloway for
one month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both in and out of Parliament, day
after day, and week after week, Mr. Herbert Gladstone
was being urged to extend to the Suffragist
prisoners, the treatment that his own father and
every Liberal statesman had declared to be due to
political offenders, and the protests were rendered the
more pointed because at this very time there were
a number of men political prisoners, serving sentences
in Ireland, who were actually receiving all
the privileges which were being demanded on behalf
of the Suffragettes. These men were convicted
of boycotting and cattle driving. They were allowed
to provide their own clothing, furniture,
food and malted liquor and to have their own medical
attendant and medicines sent in to them at any
time. They were allowed to smoke and to have
books, newspapers and other means of occupation,
to carry on their profession, if that were possible.
They were allowed to correspond freely with their
friends and to receive visitors every day, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
exempted from prison tasks. Their imprisonment,
in fact, entailed little more than the loss of freedom
to come and go as they wished. The case of Mr.
Farrell, M. P., who, whilst the Suffragette leaders
were in Holloway gaol, was convicted of inciting to
cattle driving, was technically parallel to that of
Mrs. Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst, and Mrs.
Drummond; but whilst both he and they were alike
ordered to be bound over to keep the peace and to
find sureties for their good behaviour; on their common
refusal, he was committed to prison in the First
Division, whilst they were put in the second class.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, news of the prisoners in Holloway
had gradually filtered out to us, and the first messenger
from them was Mrs. Drummond herself, who
nine days after her imprisonment had begun, was
suddenly and unexpectedly released. She then told
us that on arriving in Holloway, Mrs. Pankhurst
had at once announced to the authorities that the
time had come when the Suffragettes would no longer
submit to the degrading prison regulations which
had hitherto been enforced upon them, and that she
and her comrades would begin by refusing either
to allow themselves to be searched or to change their
clothes in the general public dressing room. She
further stated that for her own part she was determined
to speak with her fellow political prisoners,
both at exercise, and at any other time when they
might happen to be together, for this was a right
to which she considered all political prisoners were
entitled. Seeing that it would be both difficult and
troublesome to turn her from her purpose, the Governor
gave way upon the first point, and agreed that
the Suffragist prisoners should be allowed to undress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>privately in separate cells; but in regard to any
other matters he declared that the Home Secretary
must be communicated with. Mrs. Pankhurst and
Christabel, therefore, at once addressed petitions to
Mr. Herbert Gladstone, claiming that as political
prisoners both they and the other Suffragettes should
be permitted to write and receive letters; to associate
with their fellow political prisoners; to receive visits
from their friends; to attend to business matters as
far as possible; to have books and newspapers sent
in to them; to wear their own clothing, and to provide
their own food. Mr. Gladstone refused to
comply with any of the requests, and the prison rules
were enforced with all their accustomed vigour, except
that for the first week Mrs. Pankhurst was allowed,
without challenge, to speak to her fellow
prisoners. On Sunday, November 1st, however, the
wardress suddenly called her out of the ranks,
sharply reprimanded her for speaking and, when she
refused to give a promise never to do so again,
ordered her to return to her cell. Hearing this, the
other Suffragettes came running across the yard and
clustered around, giving three cheers for Mrs. Pankhurst,
whilst the wardress blew her whistle and
dozens of others appeared to drive the Suffragettes
inside.</p>

<div id="Illus19" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="600" height="364" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Ejection of a woman questioner from Birrell's meeting in the City Temple
November 12th, 1908</p></div>
</div>

<p>It happened that on that same morning, she never
could tell why, Mrs. Drummond's cell had not been
unlocked at the time for exercise, and she had been
left behind whilst the others had gone out into the
yard. She was sitting wondering what had happened,
when she suddenly heard the sound of cheers.
At once she hastily dragged her plank bed to the
window and, clambering up, saw the Suffragettes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
their prison dress, with numbers of wardresses after
them, running across the yard in all directions.
Then they disappeared and all was quiet. When
next she was let out into the corridor and when she
was taken to the chapel, she saw no sign of her comrades,
and though she asked the wardress for news
of them, no answer was returned. It was on the
same evening that a sense of growing weakness that
had been upon her since her entrance into prison,
overcame her and she must have fainted suddenly,
for she was found by the wardress lying unconscious
on the floor. She was carried to a hospital cell and
put to bed, and as she begged for more air, the outer
door was thrown open, and only the gate with which
hospital cells are also provided, was closed. Soon
afterwards, Mrs. Pankhurst, who occupied the next
cell, passed along the corridor to fill her water can
and through the bars was able to tell Mrs. Drummond
briefly what had happened&mdash;that she herself
was to remain under punishment, and to be deprived
of both exercise and chapel until she would promise
not to attempt to speak again. By the doctor's
orders, Mrs. Drummond remained in bed until
Tuesday, when the Governor and the Matron came
to her and told her that the Home Secretary had
given orders for her release. As soon as the officers
had left her, she sprang up and rushed to the gate
of her cell, calling out loudly to Mrs. Pankhurst,
"The Home Secretary has ordered me out." "I
am glad," was the reply, as the wardress came hurrying
back to expostulate.</p>

<p>On hearing Mrs. Drummond's story we at once
decided that a demonstration of encouragement to
our imprisoned comrades and of protest against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
treatment by the authorities, must be held outside the
gaol, and on the following Saturday evening a long
procession of women, headed by a brass band and
a little carriage, in which rode Mrs. Drummond and
those of us who were to speak, and a brake filled with
ex-prisoners in prison dress, assembled in Kingsway
and set off for Holloway gaol. All along the route
cheering crowds gathered, and our procession grew
as we marched, and when we reached Holloway all
the roads that encircle the prison were densely
crowded with human beings. We stopped outside
the main entrance to hold a meeting, but the masses
of people were far too great for our voices to reach
them and our horses, startled by the vast crowds
which pressed closer and closer, showed signs of
becoming restive. Mrs. Drummond therefore led
off a cheer for the Suffragette prisoners inside and
the crowd raised their voices with her again and
again. Then we slowly encircled the prison three
times, alternately cheering and singing the Women's
Marseillaise:<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>During the ensuing week two batches of our
prisoners were released and each one carried out to
us further disquieting news. Mrs. Pankhurst, who
was still being punished, had been characterised by
the authorities as a "dangerous criminal," and, because
she still refused to pledge herself to perpetual
silence, a wardress was constantly stationed outside
her door to prevent any attempt at communication
with her. It was rumoured also that she was very
ill and this was confirmed by Mr. Gladstone in reply
to questions by Members of Parliament, but my
request, either to be allowed to see her for myself,
or to send in her own medical attendant to interview
her, was denied. Again, on the following Saturday,
we marched around the prison but this time accompanied
by crowds even greater than before. In the
meantime, whilst many questions had been put in
the House by Members of Parliament, the Suffragettes
who had just been released had paid many
visits to the Stranger's Lobby and eventually Mr.
Gladstone agreed that Christabel and Mrs. Pankhurst
should be allowed to spend one hour of each
day together. At the same time he refused to allow
Christabel to write a book upon the Women's Suffrage
question for a firm of London publishers, to
be published after her release, though it was well
known that Mr. Ginnell during his imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
for inciting to cattle driving, had been allowed to
write his book entitled <i>Life and Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 19th, thirteen more
prisoners were released and we learnt that a fortnight
before there had been another so-called
"mutiny" in Holloway. Mrs. Leigh had been,
falsely accused of inciting the other Suffragette
prisoners to mutiny, and as a punishment had been,
deprived of exercise and chapel for three days, and
Miss Wallace-Dunlop determined to prove her innocence.
Every prisoner has the right to lay a
complaint before the Governor, but the application
to see him is supposed to be made when the cell
doors are first opened at six o'clock in the morning,
and he afterwards visits the prisoner when and
where he may think fit and usually in her own cell.
It was necessary for Miss Wallace-Dunlop's purpose
that he should come to her when all her fellow
prisoners were together in order that each might
give her testimony. She accordingly chose to make
her application during the associated labour which
Dr. Mary Gordon, the new lady Inspector, had instituted
that summer. So at half past three that
afternoon when the Suffragettes with a space of a
yard between each other had seated themselves at a
number of deal tables in one of the corridors and
had settled down to make shirts and mail bags, she
asked the wardress in charge to send for the
Governor.</p>

<p>By 5:30, when the time for associated labour was
at an end, the Governor had sent no reply and the
wardress gave the order, "Return to your cells,"
but Miss Wallace-Dunlop gave a counter command:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
"Do not return to your cells." There had been no
previous understanding between them, but the women
sat firm, and when the order to leave was repeated
they still did not move, leaving it to their leader to
again explain that they would remain where they
were until the Governor or his deputy should arrive.
The wardress then sharply blew her whistle, whereupon
crowds of tall wardresses appeared from all directions
and lined the corridor in long rows. Then
Miss Wallace-Dunlop rose. Those of us who know
her can well imagine the scene. She has one of those
faces that, when we recall them to our minds, we always
see as though lit up, turned towards a full light
that streams upon them, and at the same time illumined
from within. The spirit that glows within
them is intensely vibrant with sympathy for others,
yet though the sadness of others' sorrow finds instant
reflection in them and we know that their hearts
throb with the bitter pain of other hearts, a quiet
gaiety is habitual to them and we think of them always
as brightly and serenely happy; it seems not
possible for a shadow to fall across the clear purity
of their minds. So we can plainly picture for ourselves
her tall, slight, erect figure standing forth, and
hear her gentle light-toned voice say to the women:
"Set your backs against the wall and all link arms."
Instantly they obeyed and stood where she had told
them, looking firm and immovable though the officials
outnumbered them by more than ten to one.
Then there was silence, and the wardresses made no
move. At last steps were heard coming from a long
distance&mdash;one always hears them away off in Holloway.
Gradually they came nearer and nearer until
the Governor arrived. Then the Suffragette leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
stepped forward. "We have sent for you," she
said gravely, "because we have a statement to make.
One of our comrades has been unjustly punished."
"You know I am always willing to listen to your
statements," the Governor replied, "but I can do
nothing to-night unless you return to your cells."
Then, on his promising to enquire into the whole
matter, Miss Wallace-Dunlop was satisfied and she
and her comrades quietly obeyed.</p>

<p>But, when the Governor came round the cells next
morning, he ordered that every Suffragette who had
been present should appear before the visiting magistrates
to answer to a charge of mutiny, and on the
following day, they were each sentenced to from
three to five days' solitary confinement and the associated
labour, about which there had always been
more labour than association, as the prisoners were
forbidden to communicate, was abandoned altogether.
Mrs. Leigh was still deprived both of Chapel and
exercise, and the others who had caught an occasional
glimpse of her, as she passed to fill her water
can, stated that she appeared to be suffering very
greatly from this close solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Again on the next Saturday we marched to Holloway,
carrying before us a white banner inscribed
with the text of the Women's Enfranchisement Bill.
There we found the police on horse and foot mustered
against us a thousand strong, barring the nearest
approaches to the prison so that, although we
again circled it, it was at so great a distance that only
once, through a gap in the surrounding buildings,
could we see its walls, and we doubted whether our
voices, loud and numerous as they were, could be
heard by the prisoners inside.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>NOVEMBER TO THE END OF 1908</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Birrell at City Temple. Mr. Lloyd George
at Albert Hall. Release of Mrs. Pankhurst,
Christabel Pankhurst, and Mrs. Leigh.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>During the autumn whilst Mr. Birrell had been
visiting his constituency of North Bristol, Annie
Kenney, the centre of whose flourishing West of
England organising district, was in that town, had
prevailed upon him to receive a women's deputation.
In reply to this deputation Mr. Birrell had said that
the Government did not intend to carry the Women's
Enfranchisement Bill during that session; that many
members of the Cabinet were strongly opposed to
the idea of giving the women the vote on any terms;
that, in his opinion, the matter was not ripe for settlement,
and also that he would not endanger his
position in the Cabinet by pressing the question forward.
He added that he was in favour of the enfranchisement
of rate-paying widows and spinsters
on the Municipal basis, but that he disapproved of
qualified married women voting and that he would
not support a measure to give adult Suffrage to
women. This last point was exceedingly interesting.
It clearly demonstrated the cynical character of the
suggestion, made by Mr. Lloyd George and others,
that to give votes to women on the same terms as
men was not sufficiently democratic to be supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
by a Liberal Government, for here was a Liberal
Cabinet Minister declaring opposition to any wider
measure.</p>

<p>On November 12th, Mr. Birrell spoke at the City
Temple, the church of Mr. R. J. Campbell, the well-known
initiator of the so-called "New Theology."
It was well known that the Suffragettes were present
to heckle him, and the chairman tried to deter them
by stating that Mr. Birrell had promised to give his
"influential support to any measure giving a liberal
extension of the franchise to women." The Suffragettes
considered that this meant absolutely nothing
at all, and continued to protest as earnestly as
they could. The result was a terrible scene of violence,
in which large numbers of women were flung
out of the church and dragged down the steps. The
W. S. P. U. afterwards wrote to Mr. Birrell to ask
what his statement had really meant. His answer,
given through his Secretary, was simply and solely
that he had "nothing to add to the reply which he
gave recently to a deputation introduced by Miss
Kenney."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though the militant tactics were being
condemned as vigorously as ever, sympathy for the
militants and a desire for the franchise were rapidly
spreading amongst women of all shades of opinion.
The Women's Conservative and Unionist Franchise
Society was formed about this time, and the Margate
and the Wallasey Women's Liberal Associations
passed Resolutions dissolving themselves until women
were enfranchised, whilst the Secretaries and Committee
members of other associations resigned their
posts on the same ground.</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Lloyd George wrote to the executive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of the Women's Liberal Federation offering
to speak for them on Women's Suffrage in the Albert
Hall. They agreed to his suggestion and it was
announced that he would make a Government pronouncement.
On this ground the organisers of the
meeting approached the Committee of the W. S.
P. U., asking that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
should not be heckled, but we replied that unless we
had an assurance that Mr. Lloyd George's pronouncement
was to contain a Government promise to
act, we could not comply with this request. As requests
that we would alter our decision continued to
pour in, Mrs. Tuke, our Honorary Secretary, wrote
to Mr. Lloyd George on November 30th, stating
that we would gladly ask our women not to interrupt
him if he could assure us that the Government were
really prepared to do something for the Suffrage
Cause, and that, if he wished, we would pledge ourselves
not to divulge his reply until after his speech
had been delivered. Mr. George's only answer was
a curt note stating that anything that he had to say
in regard to the Government's attitude would be said
in the course of his speech in the Albert Hall.</p>

<p>There was no hint in the letter of any great
Government pronouncement, but indeed everyone
knew, the leaders of the Liberal women themselves
knew, and in fact had admitted to us, that Mr.
Lloyd George had nothing of importance to say.
His speech was merely intended to pacify those
women who were beginning to falter in their loyalty
to the Liberal Party and to take the wind as far as
possible out of the Suffragette sails. Mr. Lloyd
George was as much responsible as any of his colleagues
for the present warfare. His own personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
record in regard to the women's movement was not
a good one. Therefore there was absolutely no
reason for modifying, in his favour, the rule that
all Cabinet Ministers must be heckled. Indeed his
coming forward at this juncture to curry favour by
offering empty platitudes was felt to be in the nature
of adding insult to injury. When, on Saturday, December
5th, the day of the Liberal Women's meeting
arrived, the Albert Hall was girt by an army of
mounted police. There was a general feeling of
uneasy expectancy and everyone seemed suspicious of
what his or her neighbour might be going to do.
Bands of men stewards, known by their yellow
badges, were massed in the corridors and stationed
in groups at the end of every row of seats. Nevertheless,
in spite of the fact that these men had been
obviously engaged for the forcible ejection of interrupters,
in order to protect the promoters of the
meeting from subsequent charges of brutality, "Officials'
Orders of the Day" were prominently displayed,
in which the stewards were counselled to "do
no violence to any person," and the members of the
Women's Liberal Federation were asked, whatever
happened, to "act as though they were soldiers,
silent and steady under fire."</p>

<p>Lady M'Laren, who presided over the meeting,
rose to speak with obvious uneasiness, which was increased,
when she suddenly realised that all the
women in the front row of the arena, who had suddenly
removed their cloaks, were clothed as second
division prisoners in dresses of green serge, blue and
white check aprons and white caps, all stamped with
the broad arrow. For sometime, however, all was
quiet and it was not until Mr. Lloyd George had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
been speaking for some moments, and was proceeding
to give various reasons why women were entitled
to the franchise, that he was interrupted by a tall,
graceful woman in one of the boxes. She declared
that all present were agreed as to the justice of the
cause and that a Government pledge to take action
was alone required. The speaker was Helen Ogston,
B.Sc., of St. Andrew's University, and the
daughter of Professor Ogston of Aberdeen. Her
words were no sooner uttered than a man in the next
box leapt over the barrier and struck her a blow in
the chest, whilst several stewards sprang upon her
from behind. She protested that she was prepared
to leave the hall at once, but the men did not heed
her and continued to pummel her in the most savage
way. At this the audience were astonished to see
her draw a whip from under her cloak and strike at
one of her assailants. Immediately afterwards she
was knocked down and disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Now the whole hall was in uproar. Mr. Lloyd
George strove to continue, weakly protesting that he
was in favour of Women's Suffrage, but, "Then
why don't you do something?" and "Deeds not
words! Deeds not words!" came a clear bell-like
cry. Again he went on to urge that he really was
in favour, but was met by, "Why don't you resign
from a Cabinet that is hostile to women?" "Our
women are in prison." "You run with the hare and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>hunt with hounds." Only one woman spoke at one
time and each one merely fired a short, sharp, pertinent
interjection; but there were many of them, and,
more than that, the raising of each woman's voice
was the signal for a wild outburst of fury on the part
of the stewards, who sprang upon the interrupter,
silenced her by a blow under the chin or an impromptu
gag and, after flinging her either to the
ground or across the seats, dragged her out head
foremost, hitting her again and again. Some members
of the audience struck with fists and umbrellas
at the women who were being carried past. Others
tried to protect them, but the latter were always set
upon by the officials and speedily bundled out.</p>

<p>Even outside in the numerous passages that surround
the circular hall the ejectors, some of whom
were heard to say that the affair was more amusing
to them than a night at the Music Hall, would not
allow their captives to escape and still continued to
ill-treat them until they had finally flung them down
the steps and out of the building. At last Mr. Lloyd
George stopped&mdash;the scene was becoming too much
even for him. He declared that he would rather
sit down than be the cause of so much violence.
"Yes, do sit down and stop it," a chorus of distressed
voices rose, but after a moment he went on
again with the stale old reasons why women should
have the vote. "We have known those for forty
years," "We want your message," still the women's
voices called, and each interruption meant an ejection.
"We shall get peace presently by this process
of elimination," he said. "Yes, fling them ruthlessly
out," his own words at Swansea were repeated, and,
"You will never eliminate the Suffragettes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
practical politics." For more than an hour the scene
continued. Again and again Lady M'Laren intervened
and secured a few moments' peace for Mr.
Lloyd George to make his statement and again and
again he himself promised to give the Government
message but failed to do so, floundering back instead
into a maze of arguments for and against the vote.
"If Queen Elizabeth had been alive to-day," he
ventured once, but, "She would have been in Holloway"
came the retort, and then the protesting voices
broke out afresh. Then at last, after a flight of
oratory on the excellence and the importance to
women of the measures already introduced by the
Liberal Government, the declaration came. It was
nothing but Mr. Asquith's old worn-out promise to
introduce a Reform Bill and not to oppose a
Women's Suffrage Amendment to it on certain conditions.
The women reminded the Chancellor that
the Prime Minister had relegated the introduction
of the Reform Bill to "the dim and speculative future,"
but he protested that it would be introduced
before the Parliament came to an end. He was asked
how women were to prove the "demand" for their
enfranchisement which was one of the conditions
of the promise and his reply was, "as the men
showed their desire," but the women answered:&mdash;"Men
burnt down buildings, they shed blood," and,
"the Government has ignored our demonstrations."
He was questioned as to the second condition that
the Votes for Women amendment must be drafted on
"democratic lines," but though asked again and
again "What is democratic?" he vouchsafed no reply
and at last the cry, "Where is the message?"
broke out once more and a great white banner, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the inscription, "Be honest," was hung out from one
of the boxes.</p>

<p>Of course the W. S. P. U. was, as usual, much
blamed for what had taken place. The heckling of
Mr. Lloyd George was declared to be both foolish
and wrong; nevertheless many newspapers protested
strongly against the behaviour of the stewards of the
meeting. The Liberal <i>Manchester Guardian</i> said
that the ejections were effected "with a promptness
that gave the chairman no opportunity for intervening,"
and in many instances "with a brutality
that was almost nauseating." The Special Correspondent
of the <i>Standard</i> spoke of the "grossly
brutal conduct" of the stewards, declaring that
"some of the worst acts of unnecessary violence took
place within ten yards of the chairman's table, and
therefore right under the eyes of Lady M'Laren
and Mr. Lloyd George. The men responsible for
the acts were stewards wearing the official yellow
rosette. That I am prepared to swear to." At the
same time the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, in its leading
article, though it condemned our action, admitted
that Mr. Lloyd George's repetition of Mr. Asquith's
promise was entirely unsatisfactory from the Votes
for Women point of view. Many others took the
same line, and the Conservative <i>Globe</i> said, "We
see very genuine grounds for the impatience displayed
by the Suffragettes at the Albert Hall. Mr.
Lloyd George must have known that the declaration
he had to make would have infuriated any body of
men." But the matter did not end with newspaper
discussions. We had realised from the first time
that we should be made to suffer in many ways.
Again and again attempts had been made to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
up meetings addressed both by Suffragettes and Suffragists,
but the women were hardly ever afforded
the protection of the police and, as their meetings
were almost entirely officered by women stewards
they were obliged to rely upon their own powers of
persuasion and magnetic force of will to control their
audiences. This the Suffragettes have always been
prepared to do, but it was not always done without
difficulty.</p>

<p>Already, at a meeting in Birmingham, Christabel
had been assaulted with the bodies of dead mice and,
on live mice being let loose at one of our meetings,
a well-known Glasgow daily paper had suggested
that rats or even ferrets might suitably be employed.</p>

<p>After Mr. Lloyd George's Albert Hall meeting,
such outbreaks of violence against us became for a
time exceedingly frequent. At a meeting which I
addressed just then for a Women's Suffrage society
in Ipswich there was abundant evidence to prove that
well-known Liberals in the town had bought shilling
tickets of admission for a number of men whom they
paid a further shilling each to create a disturbance
and, as soon as I rose to speak, I was assailed by
shouts and yells, the singing of a song especially
composed and printed with this object, which had
been distributed broadcast throughout the town, the
rattle of tin cans and the ringing of bells. During
my speech several free fights took place in the hall.
Walking sticks and other missiles were sent flying
through the air and an offensive smell of sulphuretted
hydrogen was let out. The women who had promoted
the meeting, whilst anxious that I should
stand my ground, were in despair at the damage
which they saw was being done to the hall, but, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>they sent for the police to quell the disturbance the
Chief Constable of the town declared that he had no
power to act. His statement sounded strangely to
Suffragettes who had seen the police always massed
around the meetings of Cabinet Ministers, and had
also frequently seen them brought in to eject women
interrupters.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Chelmsford By-Election</p></div>
</div>

<p>A few days after the Albert Hall meeting Helen
Ogston herself spoke at Maidenhead, where a gang
of men, some of them made up as guys and dressed
in women's clothes, waved whips at her and finally
drove the speakers from the platform. The only
thing that the police could suggest was that the
women should fly.</p>

<p>At this time a by-election was in progress at
Chelmsford and, in organising our campaign there,
we had at first to contend with great disorder. On
the opening night of the election the members of the
National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies were
entirely swept from their platform in the Market
Square, whilst a mob of hooligans surrounded the
lorry from which we were speaking and dragged it
down a hill into the darkness away from the street
lamps. Though, aided by steadier sections of the
audience, we still succeeded in maintaining a semblance
of order, as soon as we descended from the
cart the rowdies crushed and jostled us so unmercifully
that had it not been for some men who fought
for us and who were seriously bruised in the struggle,
we should have been trampled under foot. We were
at last dragged for safety into the entrance hall of
the Municipal buildings where a banquet was being
held. The head waiter, who stood at the door, was
exceedingly anxious to get rid both of us and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
noisy crowd that remained clamouring outside, and
we were therefore taken by an underground passage
to the Police Court, and kept waiting there for an
hour.</p>

<p>This sort of thing did not continue long in Chelmsford,
for, as has invariably been the case, as soon as
the Suffragettes became known to the people, the
hostility which was at first manifested towards them
entirely disappeared. Mrs. Drummond was the
heroine of this election, for the W. S. P. U. campaign
was entirely organised by her. In the illustration
she is shown distributing leaflets to the farmers
in the Chelmsford Market Place at the close of
her speech to them. The result of the poll was a
fall of nearly twenty per cent. in the Liberal vote,
and a piling-up of one hostile majority against them
from 454 to 2,565, which was generally acknowledged
in the constituency to be largely due to the
Suffragettes.</p>

<p>The violence of the rowdies met with little rebuke
from political leader writers and under the heading,
"Sparrows for Suffragettes," the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>
stated, "Essex has just provided two amusing
Suffragist Incidents," and described in the same spirit
the letting loose of a flight of sparrows inside a hall
where the women were speaking and the breaking
up of a Suffragist meeting by boys who had rushed
the speakers, and cast carbide on the wet roads.</p>

<p>Consider the action of a body of women who, in
order to obtain a share in the constitution, deliberately
decide to attend the meetings addressed by
the members of a Government that has the power to
grant them what they desire but withholds it. Consider
also that these women are deprived by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>sex of the principal constitutional means of pressing
their claim and that their action is taken at great
personal risk. Then contrast the action of these
women with that of a crowd of men who, absolutely
careless of injuring either persons or property, and
merely because they imagine that their victims are
unpopular or opposed to those whom they believe to
be their own political friends, deliberately set out
with the intention of breaking up the meetings of
women who are withholding no man's rights from
him and who have no power to give rights to anyone,
but who are merely struggling to obtain the
franchise which their assailants themselves possess.
Surely no one with an unprejudiced mind could consider
that there is a parallel between the case of those
particular women and those particular men. Party
politicians had before them frequent examples of the
two cases and they decided that there was no parallel.
They decided that the action of the men was excusable,
but that the action of the women must be condemned
in the most emphatic terms and must be
sternly repressed at any cost.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The human letters dispatched by Miss Jessie Kenney to
Mr. Asquith at No. 10 Downing Street, Jan. 23, 1909</p></div>
</div>

<p>A measure called the Public Meeting Bill providing
that any person who acted in a disorderly manner
in order to prevent the transaction of the business
for which a meeting had been called together should
be rendered liable to a fine not exceeding £5 or to
imprisonment for a period not exceeding one month,
was therefore laid before Parliament by Lord Robert
Cecil. As the slightest interjection or the most pertinent
question by a Suffragette had now become the
signal for a scene of disturbance, it was clearly apparent
that they would not be able to raise their
voices at the meetings of Cabinet Ministers without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
rendering themselves liable to the suggested penalties.
Though the Bill was introduced but a few days
before the end of the Session, the Government at
once provided for it the facilities which had been
denied to that equally short measure to enfranchise
the women of the country, and it was quickly rushed
through the two Houses and became law before the
end of the year.</p>

<p>Party feeling on the one hand, and public indifference
on the other, veiled for the time being the serious
and revolutionary nature of this measure and
allowed it to be placed on the statute book with
scarcely a word of discussion or protest. Nevertheless
it struck at one of our most ancient and fundamental
national customs. Describing the ancient
governmental assemblies of the Saxon peoples
Tacitus explains that though, as a rule, only the more
distinguished members of the community put forward
new proposals, all had a right to be present
and the by-standers at once expressed their opinion in
regard to all suggestions. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The eldest opens the proceedings, then each man speaks
according as distinguished by age, family, renown in war or
eloquence. No one commands, only the personal dignity residing
in him exercises its influence. No distinction of rank
exists; the Assembly determines and its determination is law.
Proposals, when deemed acceptable, are hailed with loud
acclaim and clash of arms. A loud shout of dissent rejects
what appears to be unacceptable.</p>
</div>

<p>Our present system of Government is, after all,
the direct descendant of these ancient assemblies.
Largely owing to the distinctions of class which have
sprung up and have grown more and more complex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>and at the same time more deeply marked because
of the constant struggling of those who already possess
advantages of property and of education to add
to these advantages a greater political power than
their fellows by restricting the rights of those who
are poorer and weaker than themselves many changes
have been wrought. It has come about that our
modern Parliament is elected by only a section of
the people; and that almost the whole of the business
transacted by Parliament is carried on by a small
Cabinet of persons nominated by one man, himself
pitch-forked into power by a possibly transient wave
of popularity. Moreover, our existing system of
party Government renders this small Cabinet almost
all-powerful during its term of office and the strong
party prejudice, obtaining both amongst Private
Members of Parliament and the Press of the country,
secures that the Cabinet shall remain almost exempt
from criticism, except by the followers of the
opposing party. This criticism loses in influence and
value because, for party purposes, it is directed almost
without exception against every act of the
Cabinet, whether the act be in itself worthy or unworthy.
The section of the people who are entitled
to vote and who elect the majority that makes the
power of the Cabinet possible may, it is true, dismiss
them at the next general election if they disapprove
of the way in which their stewardship has been
fulfilled; but they cannot insist upon an election when
they will and they have no power to decide that their
representatives have done well in one respect and
badly in another. It is only possible either entirely
to accept what the representatives have done or to
reject them altogether.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Procession to welcome Mrs. Pankhurst, Christabel and Mrs. Leigh on their release from prison,

</div>

<p>There exists also the right of every section of the
people to carry resolutions embodying their opinion
in regard to matters of Government, which may
either be published broadcast or presented in the form
of petitions for redress of grievances to those in
power. But what usually happens to resolutions and
petitions put forward by those who have no political
power is aptly expressed in the words of Mr. Serjeant
Hullock, the Counsel who spoke for the Coercionist
Government in one of the cases arising out
of the massacre of Peterloo, which took place in
1819, prior to the passing of the first reform Act.
"If deliberation had been their object," he said,
"could they not have settled their petition in a private
room and then have sent it to the House of
Commons, where it would have been laid on the
table and never heard of again?" Nevertheless the
old right of the by-standers, the right of the whole
people to express their opinion in regard to suggestions
put forward by powerful folk and to receive
them either with shouts of approval or equally loud
cries of dissent still exists and it exists&mdash;if it has
not been altogether destroyed by the Public Meeting
Bill&mdash;not merely for men, but for women. This
right is constantly exercised when a member of the
Government, and, to a lesser extent, a private Member
of Parliament appears before a public meeting
of the people to make proposals for fresh legislation
and to give an account of his stewardship in the past.
When he comes forward thus, the people, women as
well as men, have the right to express assent or dissent
with what he has done or with what he has left
undone, with what he proposes and what he has
omitted to propose. They have the right to question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
him and to demand an answer, to heckle him
during his speech if they will, and if they will to cry
out and refuse to let him speak until he has dealt
with the thing which they have at heart, and if they
believe that he has not dealt justly with that thing
they have the right to decide that he shall not be
heard. How else can he know the mind of the country?
How else can those who are without the Parliamentary
franchise express their will? There is
no other way and this right is one of those upon
which the people of these Islands have always insisted.
Those who have said that if this right be
exercised the right of free speech will be endangered
do not realise what the right of free speech is. The
right of free speech is the right of everyone to speak
publicly and without penalty or restraint, of what
seems important, and this old right to question and
to express assent and dissent is included in it. It is
the only refuge of those who have no political power.
The right of members of the Government to speak
freely can never be endangered, for they have Parliament
to speak from, the police and military at
their beck and call to protect them and enforce their
wishes, and the Press of the country all waiting to
note down their words and publish them broadcast
throughout the land. The right of poor and voteless
people to be heard has been endangered by this
Bill and so long as it remains on the Statute Book
it is a standing menace to our ancient popular liberties.</p>

<p>Happily, up to now, the Bill has been practically
a dead letter, but none can be sure that an instrument
of coercion which exists will not be put into
force. Had the movement for Women's Enfranchisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
been a movement solely of poor women
with others dependent upon them, as might have been
the case, the new Bill might have proved a serious
menace to the movement, but, as it happened, there
was fortunately no lack of women who were able and
willing to risk imprisonment. Therefore this Bill
could make no difference to us.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though our members might not have
left a crowd of starving children behind them, we
well knew that their going to prison entailed many
sacrifices and we always waited impatiently for their
release and welcomed them back amongst us with
the greatest joy. During the summer and autumn
bands of women in white dresses had flocked to the
gaol gates, had unhorsed the carriages provided to
carry the prisoners to breakfast, and with purple,
white and green ribbons had drawn them in triumph
through the streets. With Scotch tartans and Scotch
heather the Scotchwomen had been welcomed; four
Irish colleens and an Irish piper and a jaunting car
met Mrs. Tanner, an Irish woman, and women in
prison dress marched from the station with Mrs.
Baines on her return to London. When Mrs. Pankhurst,
Mrs. Leigh and Christabel were released,
earlier than had been expected, on December 19th,
women on white horses drew their carriage, and
behind and before there marched long lines of W. S.
P. U. members wearing white jerseys, purple skirts,
and gaiters, green caps, and "votes for women"
regalia.</p>

<p>In the evening a meeting of welcome was held in
Queen's Hall, and as Mrs. Pankhurst, Christabel,
and Mrs. Leigh appeared all the organisers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Union in their white dresses lined up and saluted them
with tricolour flags, whilst the great audience of
women sprang to their feet and cheered and waved
and cheered again as few but Suffragette audiences
can. Then Annie Kenney stepped forward holding
in her hand a purple, white and green silk standard
with an aluminum staff, bearing a gilt shield inscribed
with the great dates in Christabel's career.</p>

<p>When Christabel spoke she recalled the many thousands
of Women's Suffrage meetings that had been
held in this country and the work of the pioneers
who had begun the agitation more than forty years
before. These women had laboured well and devotedly,
yet they had not succeeded in gaining for
women the Parliamentary vote. She believed the
reason for this to be that they had relied too much
upon the justice of their cause and not enough upon
their strong right arm, for an idea had only life and
power in it when it was backed up by deeds. What
had been wanted was action and it was for this reason
that the militant tactics had achieved so much
already and would in the end succeed. The old
methods of asking for the vote had proved futile,
and not only were they futile, but they were humiliating
and unworthy of women. "I say to you," she
said, "that any woman here who is content to appeal
for the vote instead of demanding and fighting for it
is dishonouring herself." The women who came
into the militant movement did not fear suffering and
sacrifice; they felt, not that they gave up anything
for the movement, but that they gained everything
by it. "Why," she cried, "the women of this
Union are the happiest people in the world. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
have the glorious pride of being made an instrument
of those great forces that are working towards progress
and liberty."</p>

<p>That note was struck again and again, and it
was upon that note that the whole meeting rested.
Loyalty, enthusiasm, courage, belief in a great
cause, the joy of fighting for it, these things filled
the air. No one could fail to be impressed by
them. When Mrs. Pankhurst rose to speak someone
stepped forward and pressed into her hand a
replica of a medal struck to commemorate the fall of
the Paris Bastille in the French Revolution, because
she had been born on the anniversary of that day.
She was weakened and worn by her imprisonment,
but her speech, brief and somewhat hesitating as it
was, contained a pronouncement heralding important
events, for it foreshadowed the hardest and bitterest
struggle to secure the rights of Political Offenders
to British women political prisoners that had
yet been fought.</p>

<p>Two further events must be chronicled before closing
the story of the year 1908. The first is the
fight of the Scottish women graduates for the recognition
of their claim to vote under the Scottish University
Franchise which they carried right through
to the House of Lords. Though they failed to
establish their claim, they yet brought to light many
valuable new facts in regard to the rights and privileges
of their countrywomen in ancient times. One
of their contentions was that the question as to
whether they might vote should be decided according
to the actual wording of the University Franchise
Act and not according to the known, or supposed,
intentions of Parliament, for that is the rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
which the British Courts have agreed to be always
the just and proper one to adopt. There was nothing
in the words of the Act to prevent women graduates
from voting on equal terms with men, and even
if it were held that this had happened because when
the Act was passed the legislature had not foreseen
the possibility of there ever being women graduates,
the right course to pursue (because it was the
accepted course when such questions in regard to
Acts of Parliament arose) was for the women to be
allowed to vote until Parliament, if it chose to do
so, should carry an amending statute. The graduates
pointed out that this had been done in the case
of the first woman who had graduated in medicine,
in the Netherlands where, as in England, graduation
carried with it the right to vote. This lady had
claimed her right and not being allowed to exercise
it had taken her case to the Courts. For technical
reasons the case had been postponed and during the
postponement the Legislature had brought in a repealing
enactment to prevent women graduates
voting and had succeeded in carrying it. The reason
for the refusal of the English authorities to take
this course is clearly apparent, for it would have been
difficult indeed for our Parliament to carry such a
repealing measure in the face of the tremendous Suffragette
and Suffragist agitation.</p>

<p>The second of these two important happenings
and perhaps the most auspicious one of the whole
year, was the granting of votes to women in Victoria
where, after struggling for many years, the Suffragists
had at length succeeded in inducing their
Government to take the matter up and had secured
their enfranchisement on November 18th, 1908.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>JANUARY TO MARCH, 1909</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Reminding the Cabinet Council of Votes for Women.
Attempts by the Women's Freedom League, to
Interview Mr. Asquith. Arrest of Mrs. Despard.
The Seventh Women's Parliament. Arrest of
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and Lady Constance
Lytton. Mr. Geoffrey Howard's Reform Bill.
The Eighth Women's Parliament.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Speaking in December, 1908, on the policy of
his Government in the New Year, Mr. Asquith had
declared that the stream of advice as to what he
should do next session was pouring in upon him
"both night and day," and that he was constantly
receiving deputations who came to him "from all
quarters and in all causes, on an average of something
like two hours on three days in every week."
These deputations all asked for different things, but
were all agreed that "their measure must be
mentioned in the King's Speech, and that the best
hours, or at all events some of the best hours, of the
session must be given to its special consideration.
And the worst of it is," he went on, "that I am disposed
myself to agree with them all, for, as each
group in their turn come to me, I recognise in them
some of our most loyal and fervent supporters."</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Asquith was constantly receiving deputations
of men and, as he here admitted, the deputations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
were helping him to decide what measures he
must include in the next King's Speech, but he again
refused to receive a deputation of the women.
Therefore, when the first Cabinet Council of the
season met on January 25th, members of the
Women's Social and Political Union called at No.
10 Downing Street to urge their claims again as they
had done last year. For knocking at the door, four
of them were arrested, and at Bow Street, where
for administrative reasons all Suffragette cases were
in future to be tried, they were ordered to go to
prison for one month. They went cheerfully, for
Mrs. Clark, a sister of Mrs. Pankhurst, voiced the
feelings of all when, during her trial, she said, "I
felt that it was not I who was knocking at the Prime
Minister's door, but the great need of women knocking
at the conscience of the nation, and demanding
that justice shall be done."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Mrs. Pethick Lawrence's release, April 17th.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next day it was the members of the Women's
Freedom League who strove to obtain an interview
with Mr. Asquith, and, in consequence, six of their
number were arrested in Victoria Street, on their
way to the Official residence; sixteen at the entrance
to Downing Street; and six, including Mrs. Despard
and Mr. Joseph Clayton, a journalist, who protested
on their behalf, at the door of the Stranger's Entrance
to the House of Commons. The resulting
sentences varied from one month to fourteen days'
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Little notice was given of these imprisonments,
the Press evidently thinking such sensations stale;
but those active inventive brains at Clement's Inn
were determined not to be check-mated and were
ever devising new stratagems and new surprises as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
a means of pushing the cause forward. When Mr.
Churchill visited Newcastle to inspect a battleship,
on December 4th and 5th, he was approached on the
first of these days no fewer than fifteen times, and
on the second almost constantly, by women who met
him at the station, at the door of his hotel, at a reception
held in his honour, on the pier, on the launch,
on the ship itself, and again at every turn on landing,
and who presented him with copies of "Votes
for Women," urged the cause upon him in brief
hurried reminders, and made speeches to him from
neighbouring boats. Every other Minister was
similarly waylaid.</p>

<p>When Parliament met, and the King's Speech was
found to contain no mention of "Votes for Women,"
the W. S. P. U. decided that another Woman's
Parliament must be held and another deputation of
women must be sent out from it. Then again something
that had never been done before had to be
contrived for focussing public attention upon this
event. Quite opportunely the Post Master General
happened to issue new regulations making it possible
to post "human letters." Of course it was
at once determined to post some Suffragettes as letters
to Mr. Asquith in Downing Street. Accordingly,
on Tuesday morning, January 23rd, Jessie
Kenney dispatched Miss Solomon and Miss McClellan
from the Strand post office. Then, in
charge of a little messenger boy, one carrying a
placard inscribed "<i>Votes for Women, Deputation to
the House of Commons, Wednesday</i>," and the other,
to the <i>Right Hon. H. H. Asquith, 10, Downing
Street, S. W.</i>, the two ladies marched off to the official
residence. When they arrived the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
boy was invited inside, and the door was shut, but,
after a few moments, it was opened again and an
official appeared, saying to the women, "You must
be returned." "But we have been paid for," they
protested, and he replied, "The Post Office must
deliver you somewhere else, you cannot be received
here." "An express letter is an official document,"
they persisted, "and must be signed for according to
the regulations." But the official replied, "You cannot
be signed for; you must be returned; you are
dead letters." So there was nothing for it but to
go back to Clement's Inn.</p>

<div id="Illus24" class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>The arrest of Miss Dora Marsden, the Standard Bearer,

</div>

<p>Another day a facsimile of "Black Maria," the
van which takes the prisoners to Holloway, was seen
driving through the town. It bore the inscription
E. P. for Emmeline Pankhurst, instead of E. R.,
Edward Rex, and a man dressed almost exactly like
a policeman rode on the back step. When the van
reached Regent Street a body of women in imitation
prison dress emerged and proceeded to distribute
handbills to the passers-by and to chalk announcements
of the forthcoming deputation to Mr. Asquith
upon the pavement. The members of the Women's
Freedom League also hit upon a new and striking
advertisement, for Miss Matters, the heroine of the
Grille scene, floated over the House of Commons in
a cigar-shaped dirigible balloon painted with the fateful
words, "Votes for Women."</p>

<p>Ridiculous, petty, even unworthy of serious people,
you may think, were some of these methods of
propaganda and advertisement, but the Suffragettes
knew only too well that the cause which does not
advance cannot remain stationary, but slips back into
the limbo of forgotten things. On February 24th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the seventh Women's Parliament met in the Caxton
Hall. Mrs. Pethick Lawrence sallied forth from it
with a number of women in her train, but she and
twenty-eight of her comrades, including Lady Constance
Lytton and Miss Daisy D. Solomon, the
daughter of the Late Prime Minister of the Cape,
were soon arrested. Their trial took place before
Sir Albert de Rutzen at Bow Street next day, and on
refusing to be bound over to keep the peace they
received sentences of from one to two months' imprisonment.</p>

<p>There were now many members, both of the
Women's Social and Political Union and of the
Women's Freedom League, in Holloway, and one
day, whilst they were exercising together, a member
of the latter organisation, Mrs. Meredith MacDonald,
a lady in middle life, fell on the frosty
stones. Two of her fellow prisoners ran to help her,
but the wardress forced them away and, though she
said she believed her thigh to be injured, she was
forced to drag herself unaided to her cell. Her request
to see her own doctor was refused and not until
she became unable even to turn in her bed was she
removed to the prison hospital. When, at last, the
X-rays were applied, it was found that her thigh
was fractured, and that, owing to the long delay and
lack of proper treatment, she would be lame for life.
The matter was reported to the Home Secretary with
a demand for redress, but no result followed until
June, 1910, more than a year afterwards, when, legal
proceedings having been instituted, the authorities at
last agreed to pay Mrs. MacDonald £500 damages
and her legal costs, amounting to an equal sum.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a place for a Women's Suffrage measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>had been won in the private Members' ballot by
Mr. Geoffrey Howard, a Liberal Member of Parliament
and son of the Countess of Carlisle. Mr.
Howard and the Women's Suffrage Committee of
Liberal Members with whom he was working, decided
to abandon the old equal Bill and to introduce
a complicated Reform measure, on the lines of that
foreshadowed by Mr. Asquith in his famous promise
of the previous year, except that, in this case, Votes
for Women was to form part of the original measure,
instead of being left to come in as an amendment.
Under this Private Members' Reform Bill the only
condition required for registration as a Parliamentary
voter was to be that the person registered,
whether man or woman, should be of full age and
have resided for not less than three months within
the same constituency. It was estimated that the
Bill would qualify some fifteen million new voters,
twelve million of whom would be women,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and
would thus nearly treble the number at present entitled
to exercise the franchise. It would at the
same time abolish plural voting. The professed object
of bringing forward this measure was to meet
the stipulation put forward by Mr. Asquith and Mr.
Lloyd George that votes should not be given to
women except on "democratic lines."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Elsie Howey as Joan of Arc, who rode at the head of the
procession formed to celebrate Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence's release from prison</p></div>
</div>

<p>On Friday, March 19th, the Bill came up for
Second Reading and Mr. Howard, in explaining its
provisions, said that he had no hope of carrying it
into law, but merely wished to "clear the air" for
the Reform Bill promised by the Government. Sir
Charles M'Laren said that he hoped this Bill might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
help the Government to come to some decision as
to the manner in which they would deal with the
Women's Suffrage question next year, but when Mr.
Asquith arose to make the expected Government pronouncement,
he declared that the opinion of the
Government was unchanged and entirely unaffected
by the introduction of this Bill. He added, however,
that there were certain proposals contained in the
measure of which he approved, but carefully explained
that his approval only extended so far as the
Bill referred to men. Though he was aware that
the measure would not be pressed beyond a Second
Reading, he stated that the members of the Government
would abstain from voting either for or against
it. The whole debate, therefore, ended in fiasco,
and had been merely a wasted opportunity. After
Mr. Asquith's pronouncement the House divided and
there voted,</p>

<table summary="Figures of Mr. Geoffrey Howard's Reform Bill">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl tdpr">For the Bill</td>
    <td class="tdr tdb">157</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl tdpr tdi">Majority for the Bill</td>
    <td class="tdr tdb">35</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It will be thus seen that this Bill of Mr. Howard's
secured a very much smaller measure of support than
that which had been accorded to the equal Women's
Enfranchisement Bill in the previous year, for the
figures had then been: For the Bill 271, against 92.
Majority for the Bill 179.</p>

<p>The Women's Social and Political Union now decided
that another deputation should attempt to
obtain an interview with Mr. Asquith, and an eighth
Women's Parliament was held on March 30th.
Mrs. Saul Solomon, widow of the Governor General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of South Africa, an elderly, motherly figure, volunteered
to lead its deputation of thirty women who
were to carry the usual resolution to the House,
whilst Miss Dora Marsden, B.A., of Manchester,
looking exactly like a Florentine angel, marched before
with a purple-white-and-green standard announcing
the arrival of the deputation. As soon as
the women reached the street, the usual pushing and
hustling by the police began, and after an hour's
brave struggle, eleven of them were arrested. Next
day nine of those who had not been taken again
returned to the charge, and eventually the twenty
women were sent to prison at Sir Albert de Rutzen's
orders, nineteen of them for one month and Patricia
Woodlock, because she had served several sentences
already, for three.</p>

<p>On April 16th, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, our dear
treasurer, was released, and we were able to tell her
that no less than £8,000 had been collected by the
sacrifice of our members during self-denial week. A
great procession was formed in her honour and
marched from the Marble Arch to the Aldwych
Theatre, where she was to speak. What a day it
was to welcome anyone from prison! The trees
were just bursting into leaf, and the brilliant April
sunshine glistened on the silver armour of Elsie
Howey, who represented Joan of Arc, the warrior
maid, whose Beatification was taking place that very
day, and rode at the head of the procession, astride
her great white charger, with the brisk wind blowing
back her fair hair, and gaily fluttering the purple-white-and-green
standard which she bore. Then
came women and girls with flowers and banners, and
Mrs. Lawrence's own carriage covered with flags,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and everywhere were the purple-white-and-green
colours, except at one point where the American delegates
to the International Women's Suffrage Congress,
then sitting in London, rode in a carriage
draped with their own stars and stripes. Inside the
theatre the platform was covered with flowers sent
by hundreds of members and friends, and there too
the American delegates had added their tribute, a
little silk copy of their national flag.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful speech that Mrs. Lawrence
then delivered, full, not only of enthusiasm and deep
feeling, but of logic and common sense, and of unanswerable
arguments for the women's cause. She
reminded us that she and her fellow Suffragists had
gone to prison in support of the old English Constitutional
maxim that taxation and representation
should go together. Before she had gone to prison,
she told us, a birthday book had been shown to her
that had been got out for a Church bazaar. In that
book Mr. Asquith had been asked to write his favourite
quotation with his signature, and this favourite
quotation of Mr. Asquith's had turned out to
be, "Taxation without representation is tyranny."
Many stories she told us of what she had seen and
heard in prison. One morning the Chaplain had
come into the hospital where she was, and had called
up an old woman to speak to him. Everyone there
had heard the conversation that passed between them,
and had learnt in reply to his peremptory questioning
her name, her age, the length of her sentence, and
so on. She was seventy-six, unmarried, and for
the first time in her long life she was now imprisoned
because she could not pay her rent and taxes £3 16s.
"I keep a lodging house for workingmen," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
"It has been a very bad winter for my lodgers, and
they have not been able to pay me." "This woman
was quite good enough to pay taxes," said Mrs.
Lawrence, "this old woman of seventy-six, and to go
to prison when she could not meet the taxes, and yet
she was not counted fit to exercise a vote."</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence also told us of a conversation between
herself and the chaplain. "I have heard a
great deal of you, Mrs. Lawrence," he had said.
"You have started holiday homes for girls. I wish
you would start a holiday home for wardresses.
You see they work very hard&mdash;twelve hours a day.
They very often break down, and then they have not
enough money to go away for a holiday." "I
looked at him in amazement," Mrs. Lawrence told
us, "to think that a Government servant should
come to me, a voteless woman, and suggest that I
should supply a deficiency created because our legislators
do not pay their women servants enough." So
argument followed argument, and there were many
Suffragettes who joined the Union on that day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since the night on which the members of the
Freedom League had chained themselves to the grille
and pieces of that historic monument of prejudice
had been taken down, whilst two men in the
Stranger's Gallery had loudly demanded votes for
women, the galleries had been closed and though
Press representatives had still leave to come and go,
as far as the general public was concerned, the House
had sat in secret conclave for six months. Members
of Parliament found the exclusion of all visitors
to the House to be exceedingly inconvenient,
and at last the Government introduced what it called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a "Brawling Bill" which was to settle the question
by providing that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Any person, not being a member of either House of Parliament,
while present in the Palace of Westminster during
the sitting of either House who is guilty of disorderly conduct
or acts in contravention of any rule or order of the
House in respect of the admission of strangers, shall be guilty
of misdemeanour and liable to summary conviction and imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine
not exceeding £100.</p>
</div>

<p>In bringing the Bill forward the Attorney General
urged that though the House could already
punish strangers who broke its rules by committing
them to Newgate prison, their imprisonment there
could only last whilst the House was sitting, so that
those who committed an offence towards the close of
the session would be too easily let off. Moreover the
House had not the power to punish offenders without
debate and for it to suspend its consideration of
"high matters" in order to discuss the cases of persons,
who, though he declared that no offence could
be more serious than theirs, he yet characterised as
unworthy in themselves of "further consideration
than any ordinary police magistrate could give them,"
was to play the game of the disturbers and to give
them the maximum of advertisement with the minimum
of punishment. When someone pointed out
that all accused persons liable to six months' imprisonment
were entitled to trial by jury, he at once
stated that he should prefer to reduce the proposed
term of imprisonment to three months. Finally he
recommended the Bill to the House as one that would
"save its time and safeguard its dignity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Balcarres urged that anyone charged under
the Bill would have the right to subp&#339;na the Speaker
or the Chairman of Committee who had witnessed
the occurrence complained of to give evidence at the
trial. It would be impossible, he said, to say that
Mr. Speaker must not be summoned because he represented
"the quintessence of the collective wisdom
of the House of Commons," and "it would be a
most deplorable thing if the Speaker and other officials
and Members of the House were to be hauled
into court for no other reason than to draw public
attention to the Police Court proceedings, and to
make sensational paragraphs in the evening papers."
Mr. Mooney, an Irish member, said amid great
laughter, that he thought the Bill must have been,
drafted in the neighbourhood of Clement's Inn, because
of the advertisement which it would give "to
certain propagandists," whilst Mr. Hazleton declared
that the Government were merely setting up
an act of Parliament "as an Aunt Sally for every
Suffragette to come along and have a shot at."</p>

<p>Mr. Keir Hardie stated that in his opinion the
Bill was only necessary because of the failure of
members of the Government, and Members of the
House to redeem their election pledges in regard to
Women's Suffrage, and that it was because women
felt that they could no longer appeal to the honour
of the House of Commons, that they had taken to
extreme measures.</p>

<p>In his reply the Attorney General ignored this latter
view of the case, but dealt at length with the right
of summoning witnesses, pointing to the setting aside
of the subp&#339;nas to Mr. Asquith and Mr. Herbert
Gladstone, in the case of Mrs. Baines' trial at Leeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
as a proof that this could easily be done again to
protect the officers of the House, and especially the
"great officers" from being summoned. He
promised that stringent provisions with this object
should be added in committee, saying "I do not
think the House need trouble itself with that objection."</p>

<p>Evidently, therefore, the gradual sweeping away
of every safeguard of a free people against coercion,
which had been won for us by the suffering and sacrifice
and ceaseless effort of generations of our forebears,
was as nothing to the Government, in comparison
with the staving off of the Women's claim to
vote. Now it was one of the fundamental rights
of the accused person that they were proposing to
tamper with, but the House would not agree. Sir
Edward Carson, whilst expressing doubt as to the
practicability of the Government's proposals, protested
emphatically against the suggestion that there
should be a law of subp&#339;na for the House of Commons
different to that which prevailed in the rest
of the land. Finally the Prime Minister rose to say
that though, after the trouble that had been taken in
drafting it, he did not like to withdraw the Bill altogether,
he yet thought that further time should be
given for consideration, and that the debate should
be adjourned.</p>

<p>The Brawling Bill was never heard of again. Its
final death-blow was dealt on April 27th, exactly
a week after it had been discussed, when five Suffragettes
effectively showed that no threat of a Brawling
Bill could prevent them from demonstrating in the
House of Commons by entering St. Stephen's Hall
and chaining themselves to the statues of five men&mdash;Walpole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Lord Somers, Selden, and Lord Falkland,
whose names are famous in the struggle for British
Liberties in Stuart days. Having so chained themselves,
the women addressed the visitors and Members
of Parliament, explaining that they themselves
were engaged in fighting for the liberties of one-half
of the British people. With strong pincers the
police succeeded in breaking the chains, but there
was no prosecution and shortly afterwards the
Speaker announced that both the Ladies' and Strangers'
Galleries were to be reopened on certain conditions.
Before being admitted each visitor must now
subscribe his or her name and address to the following
printed pledge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I undertake to abstain from making any interruption or
disturbance and to obey the rules for the maintenance of
order in the Galleries.</p>
</div>

<p>Having signed the pledge, men visitors were to
be absolutely trusted, but women were treated as
having absolutely no sense of honour, for no woman
was to be permitted to get even so far as the signing
of the pledge, unless she happened to be related to
a Member of Parliament and no Member was to be
allowed to introduce any lady to the gallery unless
he had previously won a place for her in the ballot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On May 13th, the Women's Social and Political
Union opened in the Prince's Skating Rink, Knightsbridge,
a Votes for Women Exhibition in the
purple, white and green. Mrs. Lawrence and the
Committee of the Union were driven thither by a
woman chauffeur in a motor car for which the Suffragettes
had subscribed in order that they might present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
it to the Treasurer on her release from prison.
The Rink was covered outside with a mass of waving
flags in the colours, and inside these also predominated.
The theme of the decorations which
lined the walls of the great central hall was "They
that sow in tears shall reap in joy and he that
goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his
sheaves with him." And indeed in those bright
spring days at the Skating Rink, though the victory
of the franchise was not yet won, some of the
fruits of the struggle were already present in the
glad comradeship of the workers. Everyone
seemed to be full of high spirits, and all were keenly
interested in the success of the enterprise and, in
spite of the strenuous militant tactics in which they
were engaged and of all the propaganda work which
they were accomplishing, every branch of the Union
and every organising centre, had its stall laden with
goods. Friends from all over the world had sent
their contributions, and the Norwegian delegates to
the International Suffrage Congress had a stall of
their own in aid of the W. S. P. U. funds.</p>

<p>But this was no mere bazaar, for at every turn one
was reminded of Votes for Women. Each day as one
entered, a ballot paper was always pressed into one's
hand and every visitor to the exhibition was invited
to record a vote upon some question of the moment;
the ballot box and everything connected with the
voting being arranged just exactly as it is in Parliamentary
Elections. At one end of the hall was a
facsimile of a prison cell, in which sat a woman in
second division prison dress who herself had actually
been to Holloway and could explain exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
how the bed was rolled and the tins were cleaned.
Side by side with this was the sort of cell
which may be occupied by men political prisoners.
Ranged along one wall were glass cases containing
clever little cartoon models, prepared by sculptors
in the Union and showing numerous representations
of Cabinet Ministers in their various encounters with
the Suffragettes. Amongst a host of others, there
was Mrs. Pankhurst and her deputation at the door
of the House of Commons with the Cabinet Ministers
hiding fearfully behind a group of stalwart
police.</p>

<p>Then there was a picture gallery of Press photographs
showing the history of the militant movement,
and there were entertainments, all about Votes for
Women, by those ardent Suffragists, the members of
the Actresses Franchise League.</p>

<p>The exhibition lasted a fortnight, and at the end
of the first week, came a great surprise, for a
women's drum and fife band, consisting of members
of our Union, who had been practising in secret for
months past, now dressed in a specially designed uniform
of purple, white and green, formed up in the
centre of the rink and with Mrs. Leigh as Drum
Major, marched out playing the "Marseillaise," and
then went round the town to advertise the exhibition.</p>

<p>Hundreds of new members were made during the
fortnight, and perhaps the smallest part of the whole
achievement was that £5,564 was added to the
W. S. P. U. campaign fund. Altogether it was decided
that the Exhibition in the Colours was the
smartest, brightest and cheeriest exhibition that anyone
had ever seen. Strangers visiting it said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
"What happy women you Suffragettes are; we never
thought you were like that!" To those who read
of this movement in future years it may seem strange
that, in spite of the unremitting character of the
struggle the Suffragettes, when not actually engaged
in the fighting line, should have been so generally
merry and light hearted. W. D. Howells, in his
<i>Venetian Life</i>, and others, tell us that whilst Venice
was dominated by Austria the whole town was under
a cloud; the Italians gave no balls, dinners or
entertainments, and even the great Opera House
was closed. But the attitude of the Suffragettes was
perhaps more in keeping with the English character.
Have we not heard that though the Spanish Armada
had long been expected, Drake and the other great
sea fighters were playing bowls when the news came
that it was in sight? And now, whilst the Exhibition<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
was in progress the fighting campaign was
going forward all over the country as briskly as
ever.</p>

<p>The protests in connection with Cabinet Ministers'
meetings continued almost daily and, whilst the
strictest precautions were taken to keep them out,
the greatest ingenuity was displayed by them in obtaining
an entry. At a meeting of Mr. Birrell's in
the Colston Hall, Bristol, two women were found
to have hidden themselves amongst the pipes of the
organ. When the same Minister spoke with Lord
Crew at Liverpool, Mary Phillips, who had lain
crouching for twenty-four hours amid the dust and
grime in a narrow space under the organ, was there
to remind them of Patricia Woodlock, the Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Suffragette, who was then serving a sentence of three
months' imprisonment in Holloway gaol.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The band out for the first time, May, 1909</p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile during the spring of 1909, eight by-election
contests had been fought at Glasgow,
Hawick Burghs, Forfar, South Edinburgh, Croydon,
East Edinburgh, the Attercliffe Division of Sheffield,
and Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

<p>The Scotch constituencies, with the exception of
Glasgow, which is not typically Scotch, were the most
difficult to fight, for the majority of the Scotch people
have long been so rootedly Liberal that a very
exceptional degree, not only of sympathy with the
cause but of belief in the by-election policy, was
needed to induce any of the electors to alter their
old allegiance, and to allow a Conservative to be
returned. Nevertheless the Liberal majority was
in every case reduced. In Glasgow the seat which
had been held by a Liberal was wrested from
the Government by a Liberal majority of 2113.
At Croydon the Liberal Candidate was also defeated
by a greatly increased majority, for whilst in
the general election it had been 638 it was now
3,948. The elections at Attercliffe and Stratford-on-Avon
were perhaps the most striking of the
series. In the former contest the Liberals strove to
counteract the Suffragette influence in numerous ways,
including the issuing of leaflets with such headings as,
"WORKING MEN DON'T BE FOOLED BY
MRS. PANKHURST," and, "SUFFRAGETTE
AND TORY LIES NAILED TO THE
COUNTER." In these documents they tried to
lead the public to think that the police, and not the
Government in power, were responsible for the Suffragist
imprisonments. When the result of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
polling was made known, it was found that the
Liberal nominee had been placed third on the poll,
having secured less than half the votes which had
been cast for his party in the last election.</p>

<p>At Stratford-on-Avon, another Liberal seat, the
Government candidate was again routed, this time
by a majority of 2,627 votes.</p>

<small>JUNE AND JULY, 1909</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The Ninth Women's Parliament. Attempt to Insist
on the Constitutional Right of Petition as
Secured by the Bill of Rights. Arrest of Mrs.
Pankhurst and the Hon. Mrs. Haverfield. Miss
Wallace Dunlop and the Hunger Strike. The
Fourteen Hunger Strikers in the Punishment

</blockquote>


<p>When the authorities had first raised the threat
of punishing women under the Statute thirteen,
Charles II, for proceeding to Parliament in a body
of more than twelve persons with the object of presenting
a petition to the Prime Minister, the Suffragettes
had decided to defy the Statute. We were
indignant at the proposal to enforce against us in the
supposed free and enlightened days of the twentieth
century, a coercive law passed in a bygone time of
great upheaval and of great tyranny. Moreover
the police authorities had stated that if tried under
this Statute of Charles II the Suffragette cases must
be decided by a judge and jury instead of being
hustled through the Police Court. Deputation after
deputation of more than twelve women had therefore
gone forth but though these women had again
and again been seized and imprisoned for periods as
long as that prescribed by that Act, the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
still did not charge them under the Act of Charles
II.</p>

<p>At last, as the seriousness of the whole position
grew, our committee decided that it would be
wisest to comply with the very letter of the law and
to stand on the constitutional right of the subject to
petition the Prime Minister as the seat of power.
We were advised that the right of petition, which
had been to some extent limited by the Act of
Charles II, had existed from time immemorial. It
had been confirmed by the Bill of Rights which became
law in 1689, at the beginning of the joint
reigns of William and Mary, as one of the securities
for the liberties of the British people, the complete
preservation of which had been a condition of
the accession of that King and Queen. The Bill of
Rights declares that: "It is the right of the subject
to petition the King and all commitments, and
prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal." As
the power of the King had now for all practical
purposes passed into the hands of Parliament,
the Prime Minister, as the chief Parliamentary official,
had become the King's representative and therefore
the right to petition the Prime Minister clearly
belonged to each and every member of the Community.
This right, though it should always be
zealously guarded, is of course most essential in the
case of persons placed outside of the pale of the
franchise.</p>

<p>A ninth Women's Parliament having been called,
Mrs. Pankhurst wrote to Mr. Asquith stating that
a deputation from the Women's Parliament would
wait upon him at the House of Commons at eight
o'clock on the evening of June 29th. She informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>him further that the deputation could accept no refusal
and must insist upon their constitutional right
to be received.</p>

<div id="Illus28" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mrs. Lawrence's Release Procession, April 17th, 1909</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Prime Minister returned a formal refusal to
receive them but the women proceeded with their
arrangements.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, June 21st, exactly a week before the
day fixed for the Women's Parliament, Miss Wallace
Dunlop, visited the House of Commons with
a gentleman who left her and went on into the lobby
to interview a member of Parliament. She passed
into St. Stephen's Hall and sitting down on one of
the seats there, unfolded a large block covered with
printers' ink. She was pressing this block to the
stone wall, when a policeman rushed up, and dragged
her hurriedly away, but there remained displayed
upon the wall the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent center">WOMEN'S DEPUTATION,</p>

<p class="no-indent center">JUNE 29th.</p>

<p class="no-indent center">BILL OF RIGHTS</p>

<p class="no-indent center">It is the right of the Subject to
petition the King and all commitments
and Prosecutions for such
petitioning are illegal.</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Wallace Dunlop was taken to the police Inspector's
office opening out of the Palace Yard, but,
after an impression of her notice had been solemnly
made on a sheet of blotting paper, she was allowed
to go. She had been pulled away too speedily to
look at her own handiwork in St. Stephen's Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and the policemen told her that it was "only a
smudge." Two days later, therefore, she set out
to make a second attempt to stamp on the wall of
St. Stephen's her reminder to Parliament that the
people's liberties must not be violated. She was able
to carefully affix her notice before a policeman appeared,
but she was not to be let off this time. On
June 22nd she was tried for wilfully and maliciously
damaging the stone-work of the House of Commons.
She urged in her defence that any damage
which she had caused by affixing the notice was
entirely outweighed by the great constitutional issue
which it had been her intention to impress upon
the Members of the House of Commons. "It is
claimed by the prosecution," she said, "that it cost
ten shillings to erase the impression of the first
notice and that it will cost probably a similar sum
to wipe out the second. It seems to me that it
would have been better if the authorities had spent
no money at all but had let the impression stay."
She was found guilty and ordered either to pay a
fine of £5 and £1. 1. 2 damages or in default to
undergo one month's imprisonment in the third division
without hard labour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile very great interest had been aroused
in the attempt of the Suffragettes to force the Prime
Minister to receive them by Constitutional means.
There was keen discussion as to what would happen
and, when the fateful Tuesday came, vast throngs of
people, greater perhaps than at any other demonstration,
lined the streets in the neighbourhood of Parliament.
In the House of Commons itself there
was a strong feeling that the deputation should be
received and this was expressed at question time by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>many Members. Mr. Keir Hardie asked the
Speaker whether it was by his instructions that a
deputation of eight or nine ladies was to be prohibited
from entering the House, but Mr. Speaker
replied that this was the first he had heard of it and
that he had issued no instructions. When the same
question was put to the Home Secretary he also answered,
"I gave no instructions," and declared that
it was the police who had the responsibility of keeping
the approaches of the House open. Mr. Hugh
Law asked leave to move the adjournment of the
House on a matter of urgent public importance,
namely, the refusal of the Prime Minister to receive
the deputation and the consequent grave and immediate
danger to the public peace, but the Speaker
refused, saying that the question had been before
the House for at least two years. Mr. Keir Hardie
then asked if the Home Secretary would give instructions
that so long as the deputation was orderly
it should be admitted to St. Stephen's but Mr. Gladstone
refused to accept responsibility, saying, "I cannot
say what action will be right or wrong for the
police to take."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Christabel waving to the hunger strikers from a house

</div>

<p>At half past seven the Women's Parliament met
and a Petition to the Prime Minister having been
adopted Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Saul Solomon of
South Africa, Miss Neligan who from 1874 to 1901
had been head mistress of the Croydon Girls' School
and was now 76, and five other women were duly
appointed to present it straightway. Then Miss
Vera Holme was dispatched on horseback with an
advance letter announcing that the deputation was
about to appear. With all possible speed she rode
on, forging her way through the masses of people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
until, close to the House itself, she was met by a
body of mounted police, who demanded her business.
She handed the letter for Mr. Asquith to the
Inspector but he merely flung it on the ground where
it was lost to sight amongst the crowd.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the little deputation of eight women
were preparing to leave the Caxton Hall and the
Women's Drum and Fife Band ranged up the steps
was playing out to them the Marseillaise. The
shrill, shrill notes of the fife, were a call to battle,
the heart beat quicker in unison with that drumming
and the breath came hard and short. On the
deputation went whilst the cheers of their comrades
mingled with the deeper answering cheer of the
crowd outside. On they went up Victoria Street
and all the way from the masses who watched them
was heard no single cry against them, nothing but
one great cheer. They pressed on, first Mrs. Pankhurst
in her light coat, then the two little old ladies
and the other women following behind, but just at
the corner of St. Margaret's Church a long line of
police on horse and foot blocked the road. For a
moment there was a strange pause and the crowd
was hushed. Then the police lines opened and the
deputation passed through to the clear space around
the House. The crowd cheered and they were lost
to sight.</p>

<p>Everyone believed that the women were to be received.
But St. Stephen's was closely guarded by
police and, as the deputation reached it, Chief Inspector
Scantlebury stepped forward and handed a
letter to Mrs. Pankhurst. She opened it and read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
aloud: "The Prime Minister, for the reasons which
he has already given in a written reply to their request,
regrets that he is unable to receive the proposed
deputation." Then she let the missive fall
to the ground and said, "I stand upon my right as
a subject of the King to petition the Prime Minister.
I am firmly resolved to stand here until I am received,"
but, even whilst she was speaking, Inspector
Scantlebury turned away&mdash;he would not wait to
hear her statement. She called to him to stay and
pleaded with the by-standers, Members of Parliament
and others, to bring him back to listen but he disappeared
through the door of the Stranger's Entrance.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pankhurst turned to Inspector Jarvis,
appealing to him, or to anyone, to take her message
to the Prime Minister, but she was merely told to
go away. "I absolutely refuse," she said, and the
other ladies chimed in, "We absolutely support Miss
Pankhurst." At that, whilst the rows of Members
of Parliament policemen and newspaper reporters
looked on with interest, Inspector Jarvis seized Mrs.
Pankhurst by the arm and began to push her away.</p>

<p>There was no hope now that the deputation would
be received and she well knew that if the women
persisted in their demand to enter the House they
would be arrested in the end. For the sake of their
cause neither she nor they could ever consent voluntarily
to retrace their steps. They must refuse to
go and when, as they would be, they were forced
rudely back, they must return again and again until
they could do so no longer because they had been
placed under arrest. This would mean a hard and
a long struggle, for the police would first try every
other means to overcome them. She knew that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
a moment the violence would begin and that the
frail old ladies behind her would be hustled and
jostled and thrust ignominiously aside. And so, not
for herself, for she had borne this sort of thing before,
but to save these older women from ill-usage,
she committed a technical assault on Inspector
Jarvis, striking him lightly on the cheek with her
open hand. As she did so, he said, "I know why
you have done that." But one blow was not enough
for the police began to seize the other women and
the pushing and hustling began. Then she said,
"Must I do it again?" and Inspector Jarvis answered,
"Yes." At that, she struck him again on
the other cheek and he said: "Take them in," and
the eight women were placed under arrest and led
away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the people outside the police lines had
waited patiently until at last the news filtered
through that the deputation had not been received.
Then suddenly a woman was seen struggling through
the crowd bearing the colours. Cheers were raised
at the sight and policemen rushed towards her.
This was the signal for a general attempt on the
part of the Suffragettes to reach the House of Commons
and in ever recurring batches of twelve, that
only too soon were to be torn asunder, the women
bravely but hopelessly pressed on; whilst more than
it had ever done before the crowd showed a disposition
to help them and to prevent their arrest.</p>

<p>But Parliament went on as though nothing were
happening and when a man in the Central Lobby
suddenly shouted, "The women of England are
clamouring outside," he was at once seized by
numbers of by-standers and police and bundled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
through the door. Then tranquillity reigned once
more. It turned out that the interrupter was Mr.
Lawrence Housman, the well-known writer and
artist.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock a great force of mounted police
cleared the Square, beating the people back into
Victoria Street, into Parliament Street, across Westminster
Bridge or along Millbank. It was a familiar
stratagem and, as on so many other similar
occasions, Parliament Square was soon a desert.
But now a strange thing happened, for little groups
of women, six or seven at a time, kept issuing from
no one knew where, and making determined rushes
for the House. As a matter of fact the W. S. P. U.
had hired thirty different offices in the Square for
that night and in these offices women lay concealed
and dashed out at preconcerted moments.</p>

<p>Whilst this was happening in the Square other
Suffragettes succeeded in carrying out a time-honoured
means of showing political contempt by breaking the
windows of the official residence of the first Lord of
the Admiralty, and of the Home Office, the Privy
Council Office and the Treasury Offices in Whitehall.
Having gone just after dusk, when the lights are
lit in rooms where people are, they chose windows
on the ground floor that were still dark. Then to
small stones, around which were wrapped petitions,
they tied string, and, holding fast to the end of the
string, they struck the stones against the windows,
and, having thus made holes, dropped them through.
So they accomplished their purpose without the risk
of injuring anyone. One hundred and eight women
were at last taken into custody.</p>

<p>Long accounts of the affair appeared in the Press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
next morning and these were on the whole very much
more favourable to the women than any that had
gone before, as the following gleanings from some
of the papers indicate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The record of these attempted raids has been one of remarkable
persistency in the face of every possible discouragement
from the authorities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Telegraph.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The same paper also published a humorous pen-and-ink
drawing of a mounted policeman, four constables
and an inspector marching off to prison the tiny figure
of Miss Neligan with the inscription, "Seventy-nine
years old! Liberal treatment."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is the most successful effort that the militant section
of the party have made.... However much one may
deplore their methods one cannot overlook their earnestness;
they are out to win.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Scotsman.</span></p>

<p class="p1">Principle and tact alike are wanting in the Asquith administration,
otherwise there would have been none of the
suffragette scenes in to-day's police court, and none of the
tumult and expense of last night.... No one supposes
for a moment that such a large and influential body as the
Suffragettes would have been denied a hearing by Mr. Asquith
and his colleagues had it possessed voting power.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Manchester Courier.</span></p>

<p class="p1">It is not likely that any one of the thousands of men and
women who saw the Suffragist deputation to Mr. Asquith

the scene, much as he or she may wish to do so. There

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">There is some concern amongst liberals at the Prime Minister's
persistent refusal to receive a deputation from the
Suffragists. They doubt if he is wise in showing so unyielding
an attitude to them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Manchester Daily
Despatch.</span></p>
</div>

<p>As the deputation of women had complied with
the very letter of the law, the W. S. P. U. determined
to prove, if possible, that the Government had broken
the law in refusing to allow them to present their
petition. Mr. Henle was retained to deal with the
legal aspect of the case and he pressed home his contention
with so many forceful arguments that when
he had finished Mr. Muskett who was conducting
the case for the prosecution, asked to be allowed
time to prepare an answer.</p>

<p>When the case was continued on Friday, July
9th, a sensation was created by the discovery that
Lord Robert Cecil had been retained to defend
the case of Mrs. Haverfield upon which all the
others hung. Mr. Muskett now began by suggesting
that the women had had no intention of
presenting a petition and that the claim that they
had gone to the House of Commons in the endeavour
to do so was an afterthought, got up for
the purposes of the defence. He was soon obliged
to abandon this line of attack for the speeches
and articles of the leaders, the leaflets published by
them and the official letters of the W. S. P. U. to
Mr. Asquith, together with the fact that each member
of the deputation had carried a copy of the
petition, clearly demonstrated the absurdity of this
contention. The whole case as to the right of petition
and of the way in which that right should be
exercised was then discussed, first by Mr. Muskett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
and then by Lord Robert Cecil. Afterwards Mrs.
Pankhurst quietly told her own story of the happenings
on June 29th. In conclusion she said to
Sir Albert de Rutzen, "I want to say to you here,
standing in this dock, that if you deal with us as
you have dealt with other women on similar
occasions, the same experience will be gone through;
we shall refuse to agree to be bound over because
we cannot in honour consent to such a course and we
shall go to prison to suffer whatever awaits us there,
but in future, we shall refuse to conform any longer
to the regulations of the prison. There are 108 of
us here to-day and just as we have thought it our
duty to defy the police in the streets, so, when we get
into prison, as we are political prisoners, we shall do
our very best to bring back into the twentieth century
the treatment of political prisoners which was
thought right in the case of William Cobbett and
other political offenders of his time."</p>

<p>Then looking rather pained and blinking his eyes
very nervously, the amiable-looking elderly magistrate
proceeded to give his decision. He said that
whilst he agreed with Lord Robert Cecil and Mr.
Henle that the right of petition clearly belonged to
every subject, he yet thought that when the police
had refused permission to enter the House, and when
the Prime Minister had said that he would not receive
the deputation, the women had acted wrongly in refusing
to go away. He should therefore fine them
£5 and if they refused to pay, should send them to
prison for one month in the second division. This
punishment should not take immediate effect because
he understood that he was desired to "state a case"
upon the legal point as to the right of petition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
as he was quite prepared to do this, the matter
would be taken to a higher court for further consideration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pankhurst then claimed that the charges
against every one of her fellow prisoners should be
held over until her own case had been finally decided
as they all turned on the same point. This was
agreed to except in regard to the fourteen women
charged with stone-throwing and attempted rescue,
who on Monday, July 12th, were tried and sent to
prison for periods varying from one month to six
weeks.</p>

<p>And now the evening paper placards were announcing
a strange thing that had been taking
place in Holloway gaol. Miss Wallace Dunlop
who had gone alone to prison, had set herself to
wrest from the Government the political treatment
which her comrades demanded, and had seized upon
a terrible but most powerful means of attaining her
object. On arriving in prison on Friday evening,
July 2nd, she had at once claimed to be treated as a
political offender, and, when this had been denied,
she warned the Governor that she should refuse to
eat anything until she had gained her point. On
Monday morning she put her breakfast aside untasted,
and addressed a petition to Mr. Gladstone
explaining that she had adopted this course as a
matter of principle and for the sake of those who
might come after. Miss Wallace Dunlop has not
the vigour and reserve force that belong to youth
and she is of fragile constitution, but she never wavered
and went cheerfully on with her terrible task.
Every effort was made to break down her resolution.
The ordinary prison diet was no longer placed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
her, but such dainty food as at other times is not
seen in Holloway, and this was left in her cell both
day and night in the hope that she would be tempted
to eat, but though her table was always covered,
she touched nothing. Tuesday was the day on
which she felt most hungry, and then, as she says,
"I threw a fried fish, four slices of bread, three
bananas and a cup of hot milk out of the window."
Threats and coaxing alike failed to move her. The
doctor, watching her growing weakness with concern,
came to feel her pulse many times during the
day, but her calm steadfast spirit and gentle gaiety
never deserted her. She had always a smile for him.
"What are you going to have for dinner to-day?"
he would ask, and she would reply, "My determination."
"Indigestible stuff, but tough, no doubt,"
he would answer. So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday passed; by Friday it was clearly
realised that she would not change her mind but
would carry on her hunger strike even to the
gates of death. Hourly she was growing more
feeble and so on Friday evening, July 9th, she was
set free.</p>

<p>The fourteen women who had been sentenced on
the day of her release and heard the news of what
she had done as they were being hurried to gaol decided
to follow her example. On reaching Holloway
they at once informed the officials that they would
refuse to deliver up any of their private property,
to undress and to put on the prison clothing, to obey
the rule of silence, to perform prison tasks and to
eat the prison food and that in every way that was
open to them they would protest against the regulations.
The Governor agreed for the time being to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
allow them to retain their own clothing, but told
them that when the visiting magistrates next came
round they would be charged before them with mutiny.
The women then addressed petitions to the
Home Secretary, demanding that, in accordance with
international custom, they should receive the treatment
due to political prisoners, and decided to wait a
day or two for a reply before beginning the hunger
strike.</p>

<p>The Suffragettes had always condemned the inadequate
ventilation of the cells which they felt to be exceedingly
injurious to the health of every prisoner.
On those burning summer days the stifling heat became
almost unbearable and after several times appealing
that more fresh air should be allowed to
them, the women at last determined to break some
of the panes.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning Christabel and Mrs.
Tuke, anxious for news of their comrades, went
up to Holloway and obtained admittance to a house
opposite the gaol. There from a back window,
they called to the prisoners, who eagerly stretched
out their arms to them through the broken panes,
and in a few shouted words told them of what had
taken place. The same afternoon, a committee of
visiting magistrates arrived in the prison and sentenced
the Suffragettes to from seven to ten days'
close solitary confinement. The women were then
all dragged away to the punishment cells. Miss
Florence Spong, one of the prisoners, describes her
experience thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Entering a dim corridor on either side of which were
cells, I was conducted to the last one and the double iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
doors were clanged and locked behind me; the cell damp, icy
cold and dark struck terror in me, but the principle for which
I was fighting helped me to overcome my fears. In the dim
light I discovered a plank bed fixed in one corner of the
cell about four inches from the ground, with a wooden pillow
at the head. Opposite was a tree stump, clamped to
the wall for a seat, and in another corner was a small shelf
with a filthy rubber tumbler full of water. High above the
bed was a small window and through the tiny panes of
opaque glass a faint light filtered. Realising how quickly
the light was waning I hurriedly examined my cell. I discovered
two pools of water near the head of the bed which
never dried up. There was a small square of glass high
above the door and through this the light of a tiny gas jet
flickered from the corridor outside. This was lit at five
o'clock and just enabled me to see the objects in my cell.
At eight o'clock three wardresses brought me a mattress and
some rugs, and again the doors clanged to and I was alone.
I will not speak of that night; I leave it for your imagination.
At six the next morning I was told to get up, my
mattress and bed clothes were taken from my cell and a tiny
bowl of water was brought me to wash in, and that was
the only wash I was allowed every twenty-four hours.</p>
</div>

<p>"It is wrong that there should be such places
to-day," Miss Florence Cooke told the Governor,
"they would drive any ordinary prisoner mad," and
she tells us:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I saw all means of protest had been taken from me except
one, and that was to do what Miss Wallace Dunlop
had done, to refuse to take any food. The hardest time
was the first twenty-four hours. Milk was brought to me
which I felt I could have taken very willingly, but I put it
from me. Then the wardress brought me in some food. I
said to her, "Will you please take that out?" She refused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
I therefore took the tin in which the food was and rolled it
out of the cell and what was in it went upon the ground.</p>
</div>

<div id="Illus30" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="600" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The hunger strikers waving to Christabel from their prison cells, July, 1909</p></div>
</div>

<p>This is important, because Mr. Gladstone afterwards
charged the Suffragettes with having thrown
food at the wardresses.</p>

<p>Miss Cooke goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I was particularly careful in what I did to be polite and I
believe all the other Suffragettes were the same. On Friday
I took to my bed and the doctor told me that if I persisted I
should get a fever, but I was absolutely determined to do my
part, at whatever sacrifice, and I told the Governor that so
long as I was responsible for my action I should refuse to take
food.</p>

<p>On Sunday night I was removed to the hospital and there
a fresh effort was made to get me to take food. Medicine
was brought to me, which I absolutely refused, knowing that
it was either food in disguise or else intended to aggravate
my hunger. On Monday afternoon my head felt exceedingly
bad and I hardly knew what I was doing, but I determined
that I would not give in. In the evening the
Governor came to me and said, "Be very calm." I said to
him, "There is a supreme power which gives us strength to
bear whatever comes to us." He said, "I have orders to
release you," and I said to him, "Does Mr. Gladstone prefer
this to doing us justice?"</p>
</div>

<p>The other prisoners all told similar stories, each
of which unconsciously displayed the most wonderful
heroism. One day Miss Mary Allen fell fainting
on the stone floor of her punishment cell and
when, weak and numb with cold, she regained consciousness,
she sang the Women's Marseillaise to
cheer herself, and to her delight the occupant of the
next cell joined in. So, bravely struggling, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
of the women won her way out to freedom, having
fasted bravely, some for six and a half, others for
six, five and a half, or five days.</p>

<p>Think of the courage of it! To be confined
there in semi-darkness when a word would procure
release. To withstand the terrible pangs of hunger
with food always before one's eyes, distracted by the
fever of that unhealthy and f&#339;tid place. To feel
oneself growing gradually weaker and weaker, and
to know that but a little more, perhaps suddenly,
any moment without warning, and the heart will
stop. And yet never, never to falter, always to
cling on to the word of their faith and the great
impersonal ideal. Think of the wonderful courage
of it! And after their release it was only with
utmost care and cherishing that these dear women
were won back to life and in their feeble weariness
they felt, even when lying on the softest bed, as
though they were stretched upon iron bars.</p>

<p>There were some generous souls, the Reverend
Hugh Chapman of the Royal Chapel of the Savoy
and others, who raised their voices in protest, and
in appeal to the authorities to withdraw their obstinate
opposition to the cause for which the women
fought, or at least to extend to them the recognised
usages of political warfare. It was shown that
even according to the strict letter of the law, the
women, their stone-throwing notwithstanding, had
an unassailable claim to political treatment. In the
case of <i>In-re-Castioni</i>, reported in Pitt Cobbett's
"Leading Cases on International Law," a Swiss
subject named Castioni had been arrested in England
at the requisition of the Swiss Government, on a
charge of murder. Under the provisions of the Extradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Act of 1870, the prisoner could not be extradited
if the offence was of a political character,
and the judges unanimously held that even such offences
as murder and assassination must be considered
political, if committed in the belief that they
would promote the political end in view, and as part
of, and incidental to, a genuine political agitation,
rising, or disturbance.</p>

<p>But the legal and moral justice of their claim,
and the heroic courage of the women, were alike disregarded
by the Government, and when, on July 21st,
private Members of Parliament pressed Mr. Gladstone
to relent, and to do justice to the women political
prisoners, he retaliated by asserting that they
had both kicked and bitten the wardresses. The
charge was indignantly repudiated by every prisoner
and after careful enquiry the W. S. P. U. issued
a statement denying the accusations. Three
days later it was announced by the press that Mr.
Gladstone had held an enquiry at the prison, as a
result of which he had decided that the allegations
of assault against the Suffragette prisoners had been
clearly proved. The W. S. P. U. then wrote urging
that the case ought not to be judged on one-sided
evidence and claiming that the Home Secretary
should allow the fourteen Suffragettes, against whom
the charges had been made to put their side of the
matter before him. Mr. Gladstone merely replied
that he had already directed proceedings to be taken
against Miss Theresa Garnett and Mrs. Dove-Wilcox,
two of the Suffragettes concerned, and that these
proceedings would afford full opportunity for them
to swear to their version of the facts before the
Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 4th these trumped-up charges were
heard at the North London Police Court. During
the whole course of the agitation the Suffragettes
had never sought either to conceal or to deny what
they had done, or to escape punishment for their
actions, and the police had always readily admitted
that they could unhesitatingly accept the word of a
Suffragette. It is unnecessary, therefore, to give at
any length the evidence put forward at the trial of
these two women. Their own statements, calmly
and carefully given, even the magistrate, although
he punished them, certainly believed.</p>

<p>Miss Theresa Garnett was accused of biting one
wardress and striking another. In defending herself
against these charges she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On Wednesday, July 14th, wardresses entered my cell
and ordered me to come down to see the visiting magistrates.
I stopped to pick up my bag<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to bring with me.
Immediately the wardresses intervened between me and my
bag to prevent me taking it and a scuffle ensued, in the
course of which I found myself on my back, and two or
three other wardresses came into my cell. In this struggle
I did not strike or bite or assault any of the wardresses
in any way, but used such force as I was able to put forth
in order to regain possession of my property. One of the
wardresses tore my dress and it is quite likely that as I took
hold of her her dress became torn. I was then conducted
to the head of the stairs, and seeing that further attempts
to retain my property would be of no avail, I walked quietly
down into the magistrates' room. When I was there the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
charges of breach of prison discipline were made against
me and the matron further charged me with having torn
the dress of one of the wardresses whilst I was being brought
into the room, but no charge of biting the finger of the
wardress was made against me. I was then asked whether
I had any apology to make.... I was sentenced to
eight days' solitary confinement and I made no resistance
as I was marched away to a punishment cell. Since I
learned that this charge was to be brought against me I have
been wondering how it could have arisen. I do not believe
that the wardresses would purposely fabricate a charge
against me. I am led therefore to suppose that this charge
rests upon a mistake. You will have noticed, Sir, that no
charge of biting the wardress's finger was preferred against
me in the presence of the visiting magistrates, whilst a charge
of tearing the wardress's dress, which occurred at the same
time that my other act is alleged to have happened, was reported
to them then and there. I can only suppose therefore
that this charge was an afterthought and that, finding
a wound on her finger, the wardress concluded that it had
been produced by a bite. Now, Sir, I have dressed myself
to-day exactly in the way in which I was dressed that
day in Holloway and you will notice that I am wearing
this portcullis brooch on my left side.</p>
</div>

<p>At this Miss Garnett unbuttoned and took off the
coat she was wearing and the magistrate rudely
said: "I suppose you could bite as well in one dress
as in another."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I have already told you that my dress was torn," she
went on. "You will see that it is torn close to the brooch.
I think it is exceedingly probable that the wardress who
tore my dress received a wound in her finger from the brooch
I was wearing and this wound would exactly resemble the
wound caused by a bite."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Garnett now unpinned the portcullis brooch
which since April of that year had been presented
as a badge of honour to every member of the W. S.
P. U. who had suffered imprisonment for the cause,
and which, like a genuine portcullis, had five sharp
little tooth-like projections at its base.</p>

<p>"Here is the brooch," she said, handing it to the
magistrate, "you can look at it for yourself.
I have only this to add that if, in spite of the true
facts which I have narrated to you, you send me to
prison on account of the charges which have been
made against me, I shall go there prepared to carry
out afresh my protest against the treatment in
prison."</p>

<p>Mr. Fordham said that evidently there had been
a great struggle and that at such times it was difficult
to say exactly what had taken place. He believed
that the wound had been caused accidentally, though
he thought it was more likely that the wardress's
hand had been struck against Miss Garnett's teeth
than that the wound had been caused by the brooch.
He therefore dismissed the case, but though Miss
Garnett had been acquitted of this charge Mr. Gladstone
never retracted the statements which he had
made in Parliament as to the Suffragette prisoners
having bitten the wardresses.</p>

<p>As soon as this first case against Miss Garnett
had been disposed of, a second charge of striking
one of the wardresses was preferred against her.
She then said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On the day following that on which the visiting magistrates
came to Holloway, the wardress entered my cell and
ordered me to get up off the bed. I did not do so and she
seized hold of the bedding and rolled me on to the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
injuring my knee. I then said to her, "Is this what you
do?" and she said, "It is." I said to her, "In a civilised
country?" and she said, "You are a set of uncivilised
women." I then asked her to leave the cell and she refused
to do so, whereon I pushed her without using any
unnecessary violence out of the cell. Later in the day she
was exceedingly insolent to me in her behaviour and she
further reported me to the Governor and I was moved into
a more severe punishment cell. I informed the Governor of
the manner in which she had treated me and from that time
onwards her behaviour was marked by ordinary courtesy.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Fordham then sentenced Miss Garnett to
a month's imprisonment in the third division.</p>

<p>After this two charges were also brought against
Mrs. Dove-Wilcox of Bristol, who was accused
of having kicked several of the wardresses, both
whilst she was being taken from the cell to the visiting
magistrates' room and on the way to the punishment
cell afterwards. To the first charge she returned
an absolute denial, saying that when summoned
to appear before the magistrates she had
gone quietly and willingly, and that when she had
been charged before them, no attempt had been made
to suggest that she had assaulted any of the wardresses.
She was sentenced to eight days' close confinement
in a punishment cell, but, as she explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I refused to accept this treatment and said that if they
insisted I should have to be dragged away by force. Several
wardresses accordingly seized me to take me away. I
offered such resistance as I was able to, but was overpowered.
Outside the room some of the wardresses commenced
to pummel me very severely, inflicting serious bruises
upon me and at last I deliberately kicked two of them. I
had on a pair of thin house-shoes at the time, because, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
know, we had insisted upon our right to retain our own
clothing, so that I could not have hurt either of them very
much. They then picked me up and carried me to the cell
and on the way treated me very cruelly, twisting my arms,
almost throttling me and tearing at my hair with great violence.
I remonstrated with them, saying, "You have no
right to treat me in this way and I shall complain to the
Governor of this cruelty." They carried me into the cell
and threw me roughly onto the wooden bed, taking away
my shoes, which they did not return for some time. At first
I determined to complain to the Governor and to show him
the bruises on my arms, but on consideration I remembered
that my quarrel was with the Government and not with
the wardresses. I did not wish them to get into trouble.
Moreover, I regarded the incident as closed, as I heard nothing
of any complaint as to my action. I consider I was
perfectly justified in what I did and that anyone with arms
pinioned, assaulted as I was, would have taken similar action.</p>
</div>

<p>The magistrate refused to accept Mrs. Dove-Wilcox's
denial of the charge of kicking the wardresses
on her way to the visiting magistrates' room, but
said that it was "not of a very serious kind," and
that he would sentence her to pay a fine of 40 shillings
or to go to prison for ten days. He also found
her guilty of the second charge of kicking the wardresses
on being removed from the visiting magistrates'
room, and sentenced her to pay a further 40
shillings or to go to prison for ten days. If she suffered
imprisonment, the two terms were to run concurrently,
that is to say, she would serve ten days
in all. As she had already stated that she would
not pay any fine, this was tantamount to punishing
her for one of the charges only.</p>

<p>The two women were still weak from their first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
hunger strike, but they determined to again make
the same stand. On their arrival at Holloway, the
officials forcibly stripped their clothes from their
backs, flung the prison garments upon them, and
forced them into the punishment cells, where, in
spite of the continual faintness from which they suffered,
they steadfastly refused all food until Saturday,
August 7th, the third day of their imprisonment,
when the order of release was brought.</p>

<p>The vindictive attitude of the Government and
the sufferings and heroism of the women in prison,
spurred on their comrades outside to deeds of renewed
bravery and daring. Everywhere vast
throngs of people supported the Suffragettes in their
protests and no precautions, however great, or barricades,
however high and strong, could keep the
women's voices out. "Shame on you, Mr. Asquith,"
they cried, as he was unveiling a statue in
the Embankment Gardens. "Shame on you for putting
women in dark cells instead of treating them as
political prisoners. Why don't you give us the
vote and end it?" "Ladies and gentlemen,"
thoughtlessly began Mr. Gladstone at a Reading
meeting from which all women had been excluded,
and when there were shouts of, "Where are
they?" he answered, "Not far off, anyway." He
was right, for soon their speeches, delivered at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
meeting in the street outside, were to be heard
within, competing dangerously with his own.</p>

<p>When, on July 15th, Mr. Lewis Harcourt was
speaking at the Co-operative Hall, Leigh, Lancashire,
the Suffragettes rushed towards the doors.
Thousands of people cheered them on, crying: "We
will help you to get inside," and though the police
arrested Miss Florence Clarkson of Manchester,
Mrs. Baines and three other women, all but the first
were rescued by the crowd.</p>

<p>On July 17th, Adela Pankhurst held a great meeting
outside Mr. Winston Churchill's meeting in Edinburgh
and afterwards, amid the enthusiastic plaudits
of the crowd, she and Bessie Brand<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> made a dash
for the doors, followed and supported by hundreds
of men and women. They were arrested by detectives
in plain clothes and taken to the police station,
whilst cheering men raised their hats and
women waved their scarves and handkerchiefs. A
second charge led by Miss Eckford of Edinburgh
was beaten back by mounted police, and when Mr.
Churchill emerged he was greeted with a storm of
groans. Those who had been arrested were released
after the meeting.</p>

<p>Numbers of men, most of them members of the
Men's Political Union, were now also coming forward
to demand justice for women at the meetings
from which the women were excluded. If they had
gone there to heckle Cabinet Ministers on any other
question nothing very much would have happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
but now most terrible violence was turned upon
them.</p>

<p>At Mr. Herbert Samuel's meeting in the Corn
Exchange, Bedford, on the 22nd July, four men undertook
to make the protest. At the first sound of
the word "Women" two whole rows of seats were
overturned, and the interrupter was immediately
rushed out, whilst Mr. Samuel remarked with a sneer
that he was interested to meet "a Suffragist of the
male persuasion," but that he suspected the interrupter
of being a "Conservative hireling." A second
man rose up and cried: "I am a Liberal and <i>I</i>
protest," but the stewards at once set upon him and
he was thrown through a door at the back of the platform
and fell some six or seven feet to the ground
floor, where he lay insensible for nearly half an hour;
two other men, one of them a retired naval officer,
met with a similar fate. At the same time four
of the women who were holding a meeting outside
the hall, were arrested and kept at the police station
until Mr. Samuel had left the town.</p>

<p>When the same Cabinet Minister spoke at Nottingham
the police again arrested, and subsequently
released, four women, one of whom was Miss Watts,
the daughter of a well-known local clergyman.
A like procedure was adopted in numberless cases
afterwards. Inside the hall, an unexpected protest
was made by Mr. C. L. Rothera, the City Coroner
for Nottingham and a prominent Liberal, but in
spite of the fact that he was one of the most familiar
and respected figures in the town, he narrowly escaped
ejection.</p>

<p>At Northampton, Mr. Samuel again encountered
the women, for a plucky little band, led by Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Marie Brackenbury, attempted to rush the strong
iron gates of the hall. They were flung back by the
police, but, nothing daunted, Miss Brackenbury
climbed to the top of a forty-foot scaffolding adjoining
the Exchange, and, though the rain poured continuously,
addressed the crowd from that great
height.</p>

<p>But the most extraordinary scenes were perhaps
those that took place when Mr. Lloyd George and
Mr. Sydney Buxton spoke at Limehouse on July
30th. Some twenty men were there determined to
see that the women's cause should not be overlooked,
and as soon as the singing of, "For he's a jolly good
fellow," which heralded Mr. Lloyd George's appearance
on the platform had died away, a man was
seen climbing up one of the pillars at the back of
the hall. Having mounted some fifteen feet from
the ground, he uncoiled a rope from around his waist,
contriving a sort of swing seat for himself, and, unfurling
a purple-white-and-green flag, hung there
above the meeting. Numbers of stewards at once
rushed from every direction to haul him down, but
more than a dozen of his friends had already
gathered around the pillar. Instead of beginning
their speeches, the Cabinet Ministers sat whispering
together. Then one of them went across to Mrs.
Lloyd George and a companion, and immediately
these two, the only women present, left the meeting
and the struggle began. Gradually the defenders
of the pillar were wrenched from their posts. An
eye-witness declared that he saw "one man frog-marched
out by half a dozen stewards between two
rows of infuriated blackguards, who were raining
blows with their fists on his defenceless face." A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
gentleman, quite unconnected with the Suffragists
men, who had taken no part in the struggle, protested
against this excessive and cowardly violence,
but was at once set upon and himself flung outside.
One man, home from the Colonies, had his shoulder
fractured, another had one wrist broken and the
other sprained; another received black eyes and a
broken nose; whilst a Cambridge undergraduate had
his collarbone broken and a dozen other men needed
medical attendance, one fainting through loss of
blood some time after he had been ejected. At last
the stewards reached the pillar, the rope was cut and
the man aloft with the flag was hauled down and set
upon by the mob of stewards, who tumbled over each
other in the attempt to kick and strike at him; one
man deliberately hit him over the face with a glass
bottle. When finally he was thrown outside, the
police carried him to a doctor.</p>

<p>Now the Cabinet Ministers proceeded with their
speeches, but when Mr. Lloyd George began to speak
of the "people's will," there came a megaphone
chorus from a little workman's dwelling close to the
hall where the Suffragettes were lying concealed,
"Votes for Women," "Votes for Women," "Votes
for Women." The stewards rushed to the windows
on that side of the hall and shut them hurriedly,
but the sound penetrated still for the people of the
neighbourhood joined in and supported the megaphones
with cheers and cries of "Stick to it, miss,
stick to it." Even this was not all, for a desperate
charge was being led against the police cordon that
guarded the doors of the Hall and in this struggle
thirteen women were placed under arrest.</p>

<p>These women were summoned to appear before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Mr. Dickinson at the Thames Police Court on the
following morning, when they were charged with
obstruction and as a result, twelve of them were
taken on to Holloway for terms varying from ten
days to two months. They were all determined to
protest as those who had gone before them had done,
against the prison treatment, and when ordered to
undress and to proceed to the cells, they refused and
linking arms stood with their backs to the wall.
The Governor then blew his whistle and a great
crowd of wardresses appeared. They fell upon the
women and after a long struggle dragged them
apart, forced them into the cells, and ordered them
to change into prison clothes. Worn out as they
now were with vain resistance, they still bravely refused
to give in and their clothes were literally torn
from their backs.</p>

<p>Who would not shrink from such an ordeal!
Who would not rather huddle quietly into the prison
clothes, however ill-fitting, coarse and objectionable
they might be than be subjected to such a thing as
this, well knowing that whatever happened one must
be overpowered in the end? And these women did
shrink from the ordeal, but bore it for all their shrinking.
"A long file of wardresses fairly ripped my
clothes off, leaving me only half covered," says Lucy
Burns; "I counted twelve wardresses in my cell.
They tried to taunt and goad me," says Mable Capper,
"but I bit my lips."</p>

<p>When the prison clothes had been forced onto
them or they had been left half covered with the
garments lying beside them, to put them on as best
they might, even then they went on bravely with
their protest. The ventilation of the cells was inadequate&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
was their duty to break the panes, and,
though they well knew that as a consequence they
would be taken where the want of air was even
greater and where they could not break the glass,
not one of the twelve shrank back. The windows
were scarcely broken when vengeance followed.
They were dragged away to the punishment cells and
in these unwholesome dungeons they carried out the
Hunger Strike, some of them under conditions even
worse than those borne by their previously imprisoned
comrades.</p>

<p>In some of the punishment cells, including
that of Mrs. Leigh, a sanitary convenience, in appearance
exactly like an ordinary closet without
a lid, was fixed against the wall. There was no
water supply for keeping this clear, the inner vessel
being withdrawn through the wall from the corridor
outside, when it required emptying. When it is
realised that the prisoner remained in the cell both
night and day without a moment's intermission, and
that the ventilation was in any case absolutely inadequate,
the objectionable character of this arrangement
will be clearly understood. When the
matter was made public and commented upon afterwards,
Mr. Gladstone stated that this closet was
only put there in case of emergency and that in every
case the prisoner would be readily allowed to go to
the W. C. in the corridor on ringing her bell. Unfortunately
none of the Suffragettes who had been
placed in the cells in which these closets were, had
tested the matter, but those who are familiar with
the Holloway régime, will, for various reasons, doubt
the truth of this statement, though Mr. Gladstone
probably believed it. When a prisoner is told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
she will not be allowed to leave her cell at all for
several days and instead of being sent each morning
to fetch her own washing water, as is usual, she has
it brought to her by a wardress; when at the same
time she finds a sanitary convenience in her cell and
the usual cry of "lavatory," is omitted, she naturally
concludes that the receptacle is there for her use, and
that she will not be permitted to use any other.
Anyone who has asked questions in Holloway, where
questions are discouraged, knows that, especially if
the prisoner were under punishment, questions upon
this point would probably not receive either polite
or pleasant replies.</p>

<p>For two nights Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Leigh
were denied even a mattress and were obliged to
sleep on the hard wooden plank. The long sleepless
nights were for all the prisoners the hardest
part of the trial and as they grew weaker, their
minds, as happens to people during illness, were
often filled with strange fancies which could only
with difficulty be subdued. They feared that they
might walk in their sleep and eat the food which was
always left in their cells during the night. Threats
to feed them forcibly were constantly being made and
the horror of being suddenly overpowered was always
upon them. Lucy Burns tells how once in the night
she heard a sudden scream. "That cannot be one
of our women," she thought, "it is too incoherent,"
but holding her breath she listened with quickly beating
heart. The cry came again and again and at
last she heard quite plainly, "No, no, take it away."
Then she leapt from her bed and stood at the door
hour after hour waiting for what might come, until
at last, worn out and stiff with cold she wrapped herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
in her blanket and fell asleep with her head
against the door. Saturday evening, Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday passed.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the visiting magistrates came
round. The prisoners whom they had come to
punish were now all weak and haggard and some
were unable to rise from their beds. Nevertheless
further sentences of close confinement in the punishment
cells, which they had never yet left, were passed
upon them all. But the authorities dared not attempt
to carry out these sentences. The chances of
life and death had become too evenly balanced now,
and Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Leigh were set free that
evening and the remainder of the women on Thursday
and Friday, August 5th and 6th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile three young Suffragettes, Vera Wentworth,
Mary Phillips and Rose Howey had gone
through the hunger strike in Exeter having been arrested
in that town on Friday, July 30th, whilst
leading a crowd of 2,000 people to the doors of Lord
Carrington's Budget meeting in the Victoria Hall
there. Their arrest had excited great popular indignation
and with shouts of "Let them go, you
cowards," the people had rushed to their rescue but
the soldiery had been called out to beat them back.</p>

<p>Suffering born for a cause begets sympathy with
that cause and coercion arouses sympathy with the
coerced. Nevertheless tyranny and cruelty beget
their like, a crowd, however hostile, will hesitate to
throw the first stone but when that has been flung,
many missiles will often follow. Thus, when it was
shown that rather than do them justice the Government
was prepared to thrust women into unwholesome
dungeons and to leave them to starve there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
many days, a more brutal and vindictive temper began
to manifest itself amongst the more disorderly
sections of its supporters than had ever before been
shown.</p>

<p>On August 2nd, a great Liberal fête was held at
Canford Park, near Poole in Dorsetshire. There
were sports and games and Mr. Churchill was to deliver
an address on the Budget. Annie Kenney with
three companions attended the fête and the story of
what took place is best told in her own words. She
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>As we entered the Park together we saw two very young
girls being dragged about by a crowd of Liberal men,
some of whom were old enough to be their fathers. They
had thrown a pig net over them, and had pulled down their
hair. We heard afterwards that these girls came from a
village near by, but the Liberals suspected them to be Suffragettes
and ordered them out of the Park. Before
Miss Brackenbury and I had been in the place many minutes,
though we had never opened our lips, we were followed
by a howling mob of Liberal men. We thought we
could get away from them if we went and watched the
sports instead of going direct to Mr. Churchill's meeting,
but they crowded round us and the language they used is
not fit for print. After a time a police officer came up and
told us that we must clear out of the place, as we were causing
all the trouble, though we had never replied back to anything
that had been said. As soon as the crowd saw the police
were against' us the trouble began. There seemed to
be thousands of them surging round us and they divided
Miss Brackenbury and myself, but she tried to keep me in
view as much as she could. They did not seem to want
to do anything to her, because she looked strong and big,
but they all came and attacked me. They were calling out
to each other to get hold of me and throw me into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
pond which was very near. I shall never forget at this
point seeing a carriage in which were two old ladies come
driving up. The carriage was almost turned over and the
two women were white with fright and breathing very
quickly, but though I appealed to the men on behalf of the
two ladies they took no notice. Luckily the crowd just
swerved round the corner and I consider the lives of the
two women were saved not through good management or
through any feeling on the part of the Liberals, but it was
just a piece of luck. After that they seemed to become
more enraged. I then turned and faced the crowd, and,
strange to say, when I could turn round and face them
they never attempted to do anything to me, but as soon as
my back was turned they started dragging me about in a
most shameful way. One man who was wearing the Liberal
colours pulled a knife out of his pocket, and to the delight
of the other staunch Liberals, started cutting my coat.
They cut it into shreds right from the neck downwards.
Then they lifted up my coat and started to cut my frock
and one of them lifted up my frock and cut my petticoat.
This caused great excitement. A cry came from those Liberals,
who are supposed to have high ideas in public life,
to undress me. They took off my hat and pulled down my
hair, but I turned round upon them and said that it would
be their shame and not mine. They stopped then for a
minute, and then two men, also wearing the Liberal colours,
got hold of me and lifted me up and afterwards dragged
me along, not giving me an opportunity to walk out in a
decent way.</p>
</div>

<p>So they dragged her out, the little fragile woman
with her torn garments and her masses of golden hair
falling below her waist, her sensitive face flushed
and her blue eyes, wide with pain and horror. They
dragged her close past the house of the great Wimbourne
family who owned Canford Park, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
though the guests and members of the family who
were watching from the balcony and from the lawn
in front, were appealed to by others, they made no
attempt to intervene and saw the great gates opened
and the little ragged, exhausted figure with her
streaming hair, thrust outside, well knowing that the
nearest railway station was more than three miles
away.</p>

<p>Truly it needed some courage to face things like
this for the sake of any cause, and this was not an
isolated happening.</p>

<p>On August 8th, Miss Helen Tolson had a similar
experience at Rushpool Hall, Saltburn by the Sea.
This is her own description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The day was beautiful and the private grounds in which
Mr. Churchill and Mr. Samuel were to speak were thronged
with a great crowd of their supporters, a large number of
whom were miners. About ten of us had obtained admission
in one way or another and had stationed ourselves
at different points. As each woman spoke there was a
great roar from the crowd, who nearly all left the speaker
to follow and ill-treat her as she was being taken out.
When my own turn came I started to ask a question, but
was stopped by the hand of a Liberal steward, which was
thrust into my mouth. The next thing I remember is two
stewards holding my arms and a third coming up and deliberately
kicking me in the body. This was a sign to the
crowd to do what they liked with me and they thrust me
forward with cries of "Throw her in the pond." They
dragged me to a steep bank above the pond and here three
men, seeing that my hold upon a small tree was giving way,
tried to help me. Nothing of what happened during the
next ten minutes is at all clear in my memory. I was
often full length on the ground and I know I was bruised
from head to foot. The crowd abated their efforts to trample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
me underfoot when the word was passed that the police
were at last coming. When I was pulled up the bank again
I found that my skirt and underclothing had been nearly
torn off.</p>
</div>

<p>A Miss De Legh, daughter of Dr. De Legh of
Coatham, a guest at Rushpool Hall, quite unconnected
with the Suffragettes, was set upon by one
man who pushed her into some bushes and blew
tobacco smoke into her face. She afterwards
brought an action for assault against her assailant
and he was fined £3. His defence was that she had
cried "cowards" to those who were ejecting the
Suffragettes and had thus angered the crowd so that
if he had not seized her she would probably have
been swept into a pond.</p>

<p>On August 20th, when Lord Crewe spoke at the
great St. Andrew's Hall, Glasgow, Miss Alice Paul
succeeded in climbing to the roof and in the hope
of being able to speak to the Cabinet Minister from
this point, she lay there concealed for many hours
in spite of a downpour of rain. When she was discovered
and forced to descend she was heartily
cheered for her pluck by a crowd of workmen, one
of whom came forward and apologised for having
told a policeman of her presence, saying that he had
thought she was in need of help.</p>

<p>Later, when the women attempted to force their
way into the building, the people needed no urging
to lend their aid, and the police who were guarding
the entrance were obliged to use their truncheons to
beat them back. When the officers of the law attempted
to make arrests, the women were rescued
from their clutches again and again. Eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Adela Pankhurst, Lucy Burns, Alice Paul and Margaret
Smith were taken into custody, but even when
the gates of the police station were closed upon them,
the authorities feared that they would not be able to
hold their prisoners for the crowds shouted
vociferously for their release and twisted the strong
iron gates. It was only when the women themselves
appealed to them that they consented to refrain from
further violence.</p>

<p>When Lord Crewe had safely left the town, the
friends of the women were allowed to bail them out,
on the understanding that they would appear at the
police court at nine o'clock the following morning.
Nevertheless though they arrived before the appointed
time, there was no one to show them the
Court room and whilst they wandered about in the
passages, trying to find their way, their case was
disposed of behind locked doors and with the public
excluded. The bail was escheated and a warrant
was issued for their arrest before five minutes past
nine. At this Mr. Thomas Kerr, one of the bailees,
rose to protest and asked two minutes leave to find
the defaulting prisoners, saying that he was sure
they were already in the building, but he was abruptly
told that the court was closed. He went
outside and immediately met the ladies and brought
them in before Bailie Hunter, who presided, had
left the Bench, but though the Bailie saw them he
hurried away, whilst the Fiscal<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> tried to put all the
blame upon him. The bail was never refunded and
the women never answered to the warrants and so
the matter dropped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>The same Friday, August 20th, on which Lord
Crewe had spoken at Glasgow, Mr. Haldane, the
Secretary of State for War, was addressing a meeting
at Liverpool and Mrs. Leigh, who was in command
of the Suffragette army there had organised
her forces in such a way as to give an effective reply
to his jeering reference to what he described as the
"bodkin tactics." Early in the day she and a
number of others had taken up their quarters in an
empty house separated from the hall by a narrow
passage only. When the meeting began she
clambered through the window and swung herself
on to the roof with the most extraordinary agility at
so great a height and with so slender a foothold, that
observers were thrilled with horror.</p>

<p>A loud clear woman's voice, calling attention to
the women's demand, through a megaphone, and
then crash after crash; that was what the people in
the hall knew of the scene, whilst outside great
crowds were surging and those who looked up could
see what the <i>Liverpool Courier</i> called, "the frail
figure of a little woman peeping out from behind a
chimney stack," who as her comrades at the windows
passed ammunition up to her, hurled it onto the roof
of the hall "with a dexterity which was nothing
short of marvellous." When everything that they
had brought with them had been exhausted she tore
the slates up from the roof and flung them after the
rest.</p>

<p>The police rushed to the scene and pressed a passing
window cleaner into the service but his ladder
was too short and the fire escape had to be sent for
before Mrs. Leigh could be brought down. Then
she and her six comrades were driven away in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
"Black Maria" to the Central Bridewell and, having
been allowed out on bail at a late hour, were
brought up the following morning at the Liverpool
police court charged with doing wilful damage to
the Sun Hall.</p>

<p>They were remanded until the following Tuesday,
August 24th, but refused to find bail and were detained
in prison where, on being expected to conform
to the ordinary rules, they began the hunger
strike and were placed in the punishment cells. They
had already fasted three and a half days when their
trial took place. It was stated in the Court that
no one had been hurt by their action on the night
of the Sun Hall meeting but that damage had been
done to the extent of £3. 19. 0. Sentences of from
one to two months' imprisonment in the second division
having been passed upon them, they were
taken back to the punishment cells, where, owing
to the cold and damp many of them were stricken
with shivering fits. The order of release came for
Miss Heallis on the following day and for the six
others on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>During the summer months, Mr. Asquith had
been golfing at Clovelly and three of the younger
Suffragettes, girls of between twenty and twenty-five,
had approached him in the midst of his game and
had told him pretty forcibly what they thought of him
and his Government. On the first Saturday in September
these same girls, Jessie Kenney, Vera Wentworth
and Elsie Howey, visited Littlestone on Sea
where Mr. Asquith and Mr. Gladstone were playing
golf together. They caught sight of Mr. Asquith as
he was leaving the club house and Elsie Howey made
a dash towards him. He tried to run back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the house but was caught just as he reached the topmost
step. As soon as he felt the girl's touch on
his arm, he cried out, "I shall have you locked up,"
but she replied, "I don't care what you do, Mr.
Asquith," and as Jessie and Vera also appeared, he
called for help and Mr. Herbert Gladstone came to
his aid. The two men then tried to push the three
girls down the steps but this was not easily accomplished.
As Jessie said, "There were blows received
from both parties and plenty of jostling.
Mr. Gladstone fought like a prize-fighter and struck
out left and right. I must say he is a better fighter
than he is a politician. The Suffragettes have often
been called hooligans, but the two Cabinet Ministers
certainly showed that they too could be hooligans
when no one was looking."</p>

<p>At last two other men came to reinforce the
Cabinet Ministers and the girls were all three
knocked down in a heap. The two Ministers then
made good their escape and Mr. Gladstone
motored to Hythe police station and arranged with
the superintendent of the County Police for a body
of constables to be sent to guard Lympne Castle,
where he was staying. Of course the Suffragettes
were severely condemned for having "annoyed" the
Cabinet Ministers on their holiday, and the escapade
of these three girls was described as an "outrage,"
but nevertheless many jokes were made on the subject,
at Mr. Asquith's expense. Several detailed accounts
of his playing golf with an escort of upwards
of six policemen (some of which he took the trouble
to deny) appeared in the Press.</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 4th, whilst Mr. Asquith
was being waylaid at Lympne, scenes in which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
was a curious mingling of grave and gay, were taking
place in Manchester where Mr. Birrell was addressing
a Budget demonstration at the White City.
The platform from which he was to speak and all
the neighbouring roofs had been carefully searched
for Suffragettes and with 200 stewards and fifty
policemen in the Hall it was thus hoped that they
would be excluded. But the women entered the
American Cake-Walk show which adjoined the concert
hall where the meeting was taking place on the
one side, and the American Dragon Slide which
came next it on the other, and from these two points
they threw small missiles through the glass windows
and succeeded in making their voices heard. It was
impossible to arrest the Suffragettes who were on the
cake-walk machine without cake-walking also and
when a policeman mounted the machine in order to
effect their capture, he found, to the great amusement
of the onlookers, that he had got on to the
wrong platform and so was forced to play his part
in what the <i>Liverpool Courier</i> described as "a spectacle,
which from the point of its ludicrousness, must
stand unparalleled in the annals of police adventure";
for, as he was obliged to cake-walk forwards,
so the offending women were compelled to cake-walk
backwards. But if, as is possible, the Suffragettes
in company with the rest of the public, found the
spectacle amusing, their fun was soon at an end, for
on Monday, they were sentenced to from one to two
months' imprisonment in the second division.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>At Strangeways Gaol, terrible punishments were
meted out to them on the refusal to obey the rules,
but these punishments were tempered by kindly acts
on the part of many members of the staff. Some of
the women were sentenced not only to close solitary
confinement but to wear handcuffs for twenty-four
hours and one of them tells that, when, after a sleepless
night, the matron took pity on her and ordered
the handcuffs to be removed, she nearly fainted with
pain, whilst the wardress worked her arms to restore
the circulation. To another prisoner who refused
to wear the prison clothes, was brought a "strange
unclean leather and canvas jacket with straps and
buckles attached." Into this she was forced and
locked but somehow or other she managed to wriggle
out, all but one arm, and the matron then appeared
and ordered that the remaining strap should
be unlocked. These Manchester prisoners were all
released on Wednesday, the 8th September, after a
four days' fast.</p>

<p>On the same day were released six women who
had been arrested in Leicester on the previous
Saturday for holding a meeting of protest outside
that addressed by Mr. Winston Churchill in the
Palace Theatre. They also had carried out the
hunger strike.</p>

<p>In Dundee at three o'clock on the morning of Monday,
September 13th, Miss Isabel Kelley, clad in
gymnastic dress, was climbing a high scaffolding
erected on the Bank of Scotland from which in the
darkness she let herself down some twenty-five feet
onto the roof of the Kinnaird Hall where Mr.
Herbert Samuel was to hold a meeting the next
night. There she lay concealed for seventeen hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
until the meeting began. Then by means of a
strong rope about twenty-four feet in length at one
end of which was an iron hook, which she attached
to the roof, and at the other a running noose, she
entered the building by a skylight and found herself
on the stairs leading to the gallery of the hall. She
was able to rush in, but before a word had passed
her lips she was seized by the stewards, handed over
to the police and driven off in custody.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other Suffragettes were leading a great
charge of people to the door of the hall, but they
too were arrested. This was the second time that
women had been arrested in Scotland in connection
with Cabinet Ministers' meetings. In Glasgow, as
we have seen, the officials had escheated the bail and
allowed the prosecution to fall to the ground. Here
in Dundee Miss Kelley and Miss Fraser Smith who
had also succeeded in getting into the hall, were
released, whilst the women who had been arrested
outside were sent to prison for from ten to seven
days in default of paying fines varying from £5 to
£3. They all refused to obey the prison rules and
carried out the hunger strike, and were released on
Friday, the 17th of September, at 10:30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> after
having gone without food since the time of their
arrest on the Monday.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as it had been announced that Mrs. Pankhurst
and those arrested with her were to go free
until after their case had been discussed by the High
Court, she had made her way to Cleveland in Yorkshire
where a by-election was taking place owing to
Mr. Herbert Samuel's elevation to the Cabinet as
Post Master General. Mr. Samuel had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
acted as Under-Secretary at the Home Office, the
Governmental Department which was responsible for
the treatment of the Suffragettes in prison. Mr.
Samuel began by scoffing at the opposition of the
Suffragettes, referring to them as "wild women
from Westminster"; but the people of Cleveland
soon became ardent supporters of the Women's
cause and flocked eagerly to their meetings. He
then found it necessary to devote large parts of his
speeches to combating the Suffragette arguments.
He declared that it was a "wicked calumny" to
say that the Government had sent women to prison
for asking for votes and specially dissociated himself
from any part in the responsibility. At one
moment he stated that Mr. Asquith had already
promised to give women the vote and at another
that the present Parliament could not do it, and
again and again he accused the women of fighting
with "Tory Gold."</p>

<p>All this betrayed his fear that the women were
turning votes. Even <i>The Times</i>, that anti-Suffragist
newspaper which had always condemned the
Suffragette tactics and minimised the effect of their
work, acknowledged now that their attack was
damaging the Government candidates' chances, and,
on July 6th, the special correspondent of this paper
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women suffragists have made a favourable impression
upon the electorate and the miners specially appear to have
been thoroughly converted by the new propaganda....
Some miners with whom I have talked would even vote
for the candidate who was in favour of Women's Suffrage
without respect to his opinions upon other subjects. To
put it more emphatically, a Women's Suffrage candidate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
pure and simple, as a third candidate, would probably have
endangered Mr. Samuel's re-election quite as much as a candidate
of the Labour party.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally on the eve of the poll Mr. Herbert
Samuel found it necessary to draw up a special leaflet
against the women, the only one on any subject
which was sent out in a similar way. The result of
the contest was, as the Liberals admitted, "disappointing"
from their point of view, for, although
Mr. Samuel was returned, in spite of his added prestige
as a Cabinet Minister, his majority was enormously
decreased.</p>

<p>The figures were:</p>

again reduced.</p>

<small>SEPTEMBER TO OCTOBER, 1909</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Arrests at Birmingham; Forcible Feeding in
Winson Green Gaol. Mr. Keir Hardie's Protest;
Opinions of Medical Experts; Resignation
of Mr. Brailsford and Mr. Nevinson.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now on September 17th the Prime Minister
was going up to Birmingham to hold a meeting of
10,000 people at the great Bingley Hall. A
"bower bedecked" special train was to carry the
Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament up
north straight from their duties in the House, and
back again. Tremendous efforts were being made
to work up enthusiasm for at this meeting, Mr.
Asquith was to throw down his challenge to the
House of Lords, to proclaim that their power of
veto should be abolished, and that the will of the
people should prevail. But the Suffragettes were
determined that, if the freedom to voice their will
were to be confined to half the people alone, there
should be no peace in Birmingham for the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh and her colleagues, who were organising
there, began by copying the police methods so
far as to address a warning to the public not to attend
Mr. Asquith's meeting, as disturbances were
likely to ensue, and immediately the authorities were
seized with panic. A great tarpaulin was stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
across the glass roof of the Bingley Hall, a tall fire
escape was placed on each side of the building and
hundreds of yards of firemen's hose were laid across
the roof. Wooden barriers, nine feet high, were
erected along the station platform and across all the
leading thoroughfares in the neighbourhood, whilst
the ends of the streets both in front and at the back
of Bingley Hall were sealed up by barricades.
Nevertheless, inside those very sealed up streets,
numbers of Suffragettes had been lodging for days
past and were quietly watching the arrangements.
At the same time outside in the town a vigorous
propaganda campaign was being carried on by their
comrades, and this culminated in an enthusiastic
Votes for Women demonstration in the Bull Ring
the day before the great Liberal meeting.</p>

<p>When Mr. Asquith left the House of Commons
for his special train, detectives and policemen hemmed
him in on every side, and when he arrived at the
station in Birmingham, he was smuggled to the
Queen's Hotel by a back subway a quarter of a
mile in length and carried up in the luggage lift.
In the hotel he took his meal alone in a private room
away from his guests. Though guarded by a
strong escort of mounted police he thought it wisest
not to enter the hall by the entrance at which he
had been expected. Meanwhile tremendous crowds
were thronging the streets and the ticket holders
were watched as closely as spies in time of war.
They had to pass four barriers and were squeezed
through them by a tiny gangway and then passed between
long lines of police and amid an incessant roar
of "show your ticket." The vast throngs of people
who had no tickets and had only come out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
see the show, surged against the barriers like great
human waves and occasionally cries of "Votes for
Women" were greeted with deafening cheers.</p>

<p>Inside the hall there were armies of stewards and
groups of police at every turn. The meeting began
by the singing of a song of freedom led by
a band of trumpeters. Then the Prime Minister
appeared. "For years past the people have been
beguiled with unfulfilled promises," he declared, but
during his speech he was again and again reminded,
by men of the unfulfilled promises which had been
made to women; and, though men who interrupted
him on other subjects were never interfered with,
these champions of the Suffragettes were, in every
case, set upon with a violence which was described
by onlookers as "revengeful," and "vicious."
Thirteen men were maltreated in this way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile amid the vast crowds outside women
were fighting for their freedom. Cabinet Ministers
had sneered at them and taunted them with not being
able to use physical force. "Working men have
flung open the franchise door at which the ladies
are scratching," Mr. John Burns had said. So now
they were showing that, if they would, they could
use violence, though they were determined that, at
any rate as yet, they would hurt no one. Again and
again they charged the barricades, one woman with
a hatchet in her hand, and the friendly people always
pressed forward with them. In spite of a thousand
police the first barrier was many times thrown
down. Whenever a woman was arrested the crowd
struggled to secure her release and over and over
again they were successful, one woman being snatched
from the constables no fewer than seven times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the hall Mr. Asquith had not only the men
to contend with, for the meeting had not long been
in progress, when there was a sudden sound of splintering
glass and a woman's voice was heard loudly
denouncing the Government. A missile had been
thrown through one of the ventilators by a number
of Suffragettes from an open window in a house opposite.
The police rushed to the house door, burst
it open and scrambled up the stairs, falling over
each other in their haste to reach the women, and
then dragged them down and flung them into the
street where they were immediately placed under
arrest. Even whilst this was happening there burst
upon the air the sound of an electric motor horn
which issued from another house near by. Evidently
there were Suffragettes there too. The front
door of this house was barricaded and so also was
the door of the room in which the women were, but
the infuriated Liberal Stewards forced their way
through and wrested the instrument from the
woman's hands.</p>

<p>No sooner was this effected however than the rattling
of missiles was heard on the other side of
the hall, and, on the roof of a house, thirty feet
above the street, lit up by a tall electric standard
was seen the little agile figure of Mrs. Leigh, with
a tall fair girl beside her, both of whom were tearing
up the slates with axes, and flinging them on to the
roof of the Bingley Hall and down into the road
below, always, however, taking care to hit no one
and sounding a warning before throwing. The
police cried to them to stop and angry stewards came
rushing out of the hall to second this demand, but
the women calmly went on with their work. A ladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
was produced and the men prepared to mount it,
but the only reply was a warning to "be careful"
and all present felt that discretion was the better
part of valour. Then the fire hose was dragged
forward, but the firemen refused to turn it on, and
so the police themselves played it on the women until
they were drenched to the skin. The slates had
now become terribly slippery, and the women were
in great danger of sliding from the steep roof, but
they had already taken off their shoes and so contrived
to retain a foothold, and without intermission
they continued "firing" slates. Finding that water
had no power to subdue them, their opponents retaliated
by throwing bricks and stones up at the two
women, but, instead of trying, as they had done to
avoid hitting, the men took good aim at them and
soon blood was running down the face of the tall
girl, Charlotte Marsh, and both had been struck several
times.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Asquith had said his say and came
hurrying out of the building. A slate was hurled
at the back of his car as it drove away, and then
"firing" ceased from the roof for the Cabinet Minister
was gone. Seeing that they had now nothing
to fear the police at once placed a ladder against the
house and scrambled up to bring the Suffragettes
down and then, without allowing them to put on
their shoes, they marched them through the streets,
in their stockinged feet, the blood streaming from
their wounds and their wet garments clinging to
their limbs. At the police station bail was refused
and the two women were sent to the cells to pass the
night in their drenched clothing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid the hooting of the crowd, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Asquith had driven away through the town and as
the special train in which he was to return to London,
left the station, a shower of small stones rattled
against his carriage window, whilst a great bar of
iron was flung into an empty compartment in the
rear. The two women who had done these things
were at once seized by the police and were also
obliged to pass the night in the cells, whilst six who
had been arrested in the crowd earlier, met the same
fate.</p>

<p>Eventually eight of the women received sentences
of imprisonment varying from one month to fourteen
days, whilst Charlotte Marsh was sent to prison
for three months' hard labour, and Mrs. Leigh for
four. We knew that Mrs. Leigh and her comrades
in the Birmingham Prison would carry out the
hunger strike, and, on the following Friday, September
24th, reports appeared in the Press that the
Government had resorted to the horrible expedient
of feeding them by force by means of a tube passed
into the stomach. Filled with concern the committee
of the Women's Social and Political Union at once
applied both to the prison and to the Home Office
to know if this were true but all information was
refused.</p>

<p>The W. S. P. U. now made inquiries as to
the probable results of this treatment, and were informed
that it was liable to cause laceration of
the throat and grave and permanent injury to the
digestive functions, and that, especially if the patient
should resist, as the tube was being inserted or withdrawn
there was serious danger of its going astray
and penetrating the lungs or some other vital part.
The whole operation, together with all the attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
circumstances, could not fail to put a most excessive
strain upon the heart and the entire nervous system,
and, if there were any heart weakness, death might
ensue at any moment. In the <i>Lancet</i> for September
28th, 1872, a case was reported of a man under
sentence of death, who had been forcibly fed by
means of the stomach pump, that is to say by means
of an india-rubber tube passed through the mouth
into the stomach, the method used in the case of the
Suffragettes. The man had died. In the same issue
of the <i>Lancet</i>, appeared the opinion upon this question
of several prominent medical men. Dr. Anderson
Moxey, M.D., M.R.C.P., had said: "If anyone
were to ask me to name the worst possible treatment
for suicidal starvation I should say unhesitatingly,
forcible feeding by means of the stomach
pump." Dr. Tennant stated that this method of
feeding produced "an incentive to resistance," and
that the exhaustion thereby introduced was sometimes
so great as to cause death by syncope. Dr.
Russell had met with a case in which death had occurred
immediately after the placing of the tube
"before it could be withdrawn, much less used";
and Dr. Conolly was "appalled by the dangers
resulting from the forcible administration of food
by the mouth." Amongst the various important
medical experts consulted by The Women's Social
and Political Union was Dr. Forbes Winslow, whose
wide experience in cases of insanity could not be
questioned. When asked professionally to give his
views on the subject he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>So far as the stomach pump is concerned it is an instrument
I have long ago discontinued using, even in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
serious cases of melancholia, where the victim, perhaps from
some religious delusion, refuses all nourishment. It possibly
may be regarded by some as the most simple means of administering
food, but this I challenge by saying at once that it
is the most complicated and the most dangerous....
I have known some of the most serious injuries inflicted
by the persistent use of the stomach pump. I have known a
case in which the tongue has been partly bitten off where
it has been twisted behind the feeding tube.</p>

<p>He added that forcible feeding was especially dangerous
in cases of heart or lung weakness or of rupture or hernia,
and that the result of persistent use would be to seriously
injure the constitution, to lacerate the parts surrounding the
mouth, to break and ruin the teeth.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Forcible Feeding with the Nasal Tube</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the House of Commons met on Monday
we learnt that our fears were only too well founded
for Mr. Keir Hardie drew from Mr. Masterman,
who spoke on the Home Secretary's behalf, the admission
that the Suffragettes in Winson Green Gaol
were being forcibly fed by means of a tube which
was passed through the mouth and into the stomach
and through which the food was pumped. The unprecedented
and outrageous nature of the assault
was glossed over by the use of the term, "Hospital
treatment," in connection with it. Mr. Masterman
admitted, however, that there were no regulations
which authorised the proceeding, but he stated that
it was resorted to in the case of men and women
prisoners who were "weak minded" or "contumacious."</p>

<p>Mr. Hardie's indignant protest and reminder that
the last man prisoner to whom such treatment had
been meted out had died under it, were met with
shouts of laughter by the supporters of the Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Horrified by their heartless and unseemly
levity in the face of so serious a question, he at once
addressed a statement to the Press in which he declared
that he "could not have believed that a body
of gentlemen could have found reason for mirth
and applause" in a scene which had "no parallel in
the recent history of our country." As far as he
could learn, no power to feed by force had been
given to prison authorities, save in the case of persons
certified to be insane. He concluded by warning
the public of the danger that one of the prisoners
would succumb to the so-called "hospital
treatment," and by appealing to the people of these
islands to speak out ere our annals had been stained
by such a tragedy.</p>

<p>Others hastened to second this protest. Mr. C.
Mansell-Moullin, M.D., F.R.C.S., wrote to <i>The
Times</i>, as a hospital surgeon of thirty years' standing,
to indignantly repudiate Mr. Masterman's use
of the term "hospital treatment," declaring that it
was a "foul libel" for that "violence and brutality
have no place in hospitals as Mr. Masterman ought
to know." Dr. Forbes Ross of Harley Street wrote
to the Press saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>As a medical man, without any particular feeling for the
cause of the Suffragettes, I consider that forcible feeding
by the methods employed is an act of brutality beyond common
endurance, and I am astounded that it is possible for
Members of Parliament, with mothers, wives and sisters of
their own, to allow it.</p>
</div>

<p>A memorial signed by 116 doctors, headed by Sir
Victor Horsley, F.R.C.S., W. Hugh Fenton, M.D.
M.A., C. Mansell-Moullin, M.D., F.R.C.S., Forbes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
Winslow, M.D., and Alexander Haig, M.D.,
F.R.C.P., was organised by Dr. Flora Murray and
addressed to Mr. Asquith, protesting against the
artificial feeding of the Suffragette prisoners, on the
ground that it was attended by the gravest risks and
was both unwise and inhuman. To this memorial
many of the doctors added descriptive notes of their
own. Mr. W. A. Davidson, M.D., F.R.C.S., wrote:
"A most cruel and brutal procedure. Were the
tubes clean? Were they new? If not they have
probably been used for people suffering from some
disease. The inside of the tube cannot well be
cleaned; very often the trouble is not taken to clean
them."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In spite of every form of discouragement and
ridicule, Mr. Keir Hardie continued constantly to
raise the question of forcible feeding in the House
of Commons only to be met by evasive, and sometimes
grossly, inaccurate replies from the Home
Office. Mr. Gladstone tried to shelter himself behind
the officials who were his subordinates, and to
place the responsibility on the medical officers.
For this he was strongly condemned by the <i>British
Medical Journal</i> which characterised his conduct as
contemptible.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In reply to the protests of medical men and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
memorial from doctors, which had been addressed
to him, Mr. Gladstone succeeded in drawing a statement
from Sir Richard Douglas Powell, the President
of the Royal College of Physicians, who said
that he thought the memorial exaggerated, though
he admitted that forcible feeding was not "wholly
free from possibilities of accident with those who
resist." He added that, in dissenting from the view
expressed by the memorialists, he was assuming that
the feeding of the prison patients was "entirely carried
out by skilled nursing attendants under careful
medical observation and control." We, of course,
know that this was not the case.</p>

<p>A large number of doctors, including Dr. R. G.
Layton, physician to the Walsall hospital, replied to
Sir Douglas Powell by again recapitulating the dangers
of forcible feeding. But indeed the opinions
of medical men were unnecessary to those who afterwards
came in contact with the women who had been
forcibly fed. Their exhausted condition was a form
of evidence that no argument could upset. It is important
to note also that during the year 1910 two
ordinary criminals, a man and a woman, were subjected
to forcible feeding. The man died during
the first operation; the woman committed suicide
after the second.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bulk of the Liberal Press were
defending the action of their Government.
The <i>Daily News</i> had acclaimed Vera Figner for
assaulting one of the Russian prison officials in order
to secure better conditions for her fellow captives.
It had characterised as the "one healthy symptom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
in Spain" the revolt of the Spanish people against
their Government in regard to the Riffian War
though this revolt had entailed the burning down of
convents full of women and children who were
in no way responsible for the trouble, and other
dread acts of violence. At the same time in regard
to events at home this paper was declaring that,
if the House of Lords were to tamper with the Irish
Land Bill, there would be "no wonder if all the old
methods of cattle-driving and other violence were
revived in Ireland." Yet the <i>Daily News</i> had had
nothing but chiding and dispraise for the hunger
strikers, and, in regard to forcible feeding, it now
said, "it is the only alternative to allowing the
women to starve themselves." Thus the two most
obvious ways out of the difficulty, firstly, that of
treating the women as political prisoners, and,
secondly, the more reasonable one of extending the
franchise to women and thus ending the strife, were
entirely ignored.</p>

<p>Revolted by the hypocritical and inconsistent attitude
of this paper, two of its foremost leader
writers and of the ablest journalists in this country,
Mr. Henry Nevinson and Mr. H. N. Brailsford,
resigned their posts upon its staff, writing publicly to
explain their reasons for so doing. Many sincere
Liberals resigned their memberships and official posts
under the Liberal Association including the Rev. J.
M. Lloyd Thomas, Minister of the High Pavement
Chapel, Nottingham, resigned from the Liberal Association,
and there were many other resignations,
amongst them the following: Mrs. Catherine C.
Osier, the President, Miss Gertrude E. Sothall, the
Hon. Sec., and Mrs. Alice Yoxall, the Treasurer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the Birmingham Women's Liberal Association;
Mrs. S. Reid, the chairman of the Egbaston
Women's Liberal Association; Lady Blake, the
President of the Berwick Women's Liberal Association;
and Mrs. Branch, one of the most prominent
members of the Northampton Women's Liberal
Association. At the same time prominent men and
women of all shades of opinion, including Mrs.
Ayrton, Flora Annie Steel, Lady Betty Balfour, the
Rev. J. R. Campbell and the Hon. H. B. T. Strangeways,
ex-premier of South Australia appealed to the
Government to give votes to women and bring this
useless warfare to an end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, except for the admissions of Mr.
Gladstone and Mr. Masterman in the House of
Commons, nothing definite was known as to the condition
of the outraged prisoners. No direct communication
had been held with them and even a
petition from their parents and relatives to be allowed
to send their own medical attendant into the
prison, had been refused. The fearful anxiety and
suspense endured by all concerned may well be
imagined. Again and again Messrs. Hatchett,
Jones, Bisgood and Marschall, the solicitors engaged
to act on the prisoners' behalf, applied for permission
to interview their clients, but Mr. Gladstone obstinately
refused until he was informed that legal
proceedings were being taken for assault against him
and the Governor and Doctor of the Birmingham
Prison, and that writs were being issued, and that
Miss Laura Ainsworth would shortly be released so
that the full details would be known in any case.
Thus at last he grudgingly consented to the interview,
and sworn statements were made by all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
women. Mrs. Leigh explained that on arriving at
Winson Green Gaol on Wednesday, September 22nd,
she had broken her cell windows as a protest against
the prison treatment. As a punishment she was thrust
that evening into a cold dimly lit punishment cell.
A plank bed was brought in and she was forcibly
stripped and handcuffed with the hands behind
during the day, except at meal times when the palms
were placed together in front. At night the hands
were fastened in front with the palms out. Potatoes,
bread and gruel were brought into her cell
on Thursday but she did not touch them and in the
afternoon she was taken, still handcuffed, before the
magistrates who sentenced her to a further nine days
in the punishment cell. At midnight on Thursday,
her wrists being terribly swollen and painful, the
handcuffs were removed.</p>

<p>She still refused food and on Saturday she was
taken to the doctor's room. Here is her account of
the affair:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The doctor said: "You must listen carefully to what
I have to say. I have my orders from my superior officers"
(he had a blue official paper in his hand to which
he referred) "that you are not to be released even on medical
grounds. If you still refrain from food I must take
other measures to compel you to take it." I then said:
"I refuse, and if you force food on me, I want to know
how you are going to do it." He said: "That is a matter
for me to decide." I said that he must prove that I was
insane; that the Lunacy Commissioners would have to be
summoned to prove that I was insane. I declared that forcible
feeding was an operation, and therefore could not be
performed without a sane patient's consent. He merely
bowed and said: "Those are my orders."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>She was then surrounded and held down, whilst
the chair was tilted backwards. She clenched her
teeth but the doctor pulled her mouth away to form
a pouch and the wardress poured in milk and brandy
some of which trickled in through the crevices.
Later in the day the doctors and wardresses
again appeared. They forced her down on to the
bed, and held her there. One of the doctors then
produced a tube two yards in length with a
glass junction in the centre and a funnel at one end.
He forced the other end of the tube up her nostril,
hurting her so terribly that the matron and two of
the wardresses burst into tears and the second
doctor interfered. At last the tube was pushed
down into the stomach. She felt the pain of
it to the end of the breast bone. Then one of the
doctors stood upon a chair holding the funnel
end of the tube at arm's length and poured food
down whilst the wardresses and the other doctor
all gripped her tight. She felt as though she
would suffocate. There was a rushing, burning sensation
in her head, the drums of her ears seemed to
be bursting. The agony of pain in the throat and
breast bone continued. The thing seemed to go
on for hours. When at last the tube was withdrawn,
she felt as though all the back of her nose and throat
were being torn out with it.</p>

<p>Then almost fainting she was carried back to the
punishment cell and put to bed. For hours the pain
in the chest, nose and ears continued and she
felt terribly sick and faint. Day after day the
struggle continued; she used no violence but each
time resisted and was overcome by force of numbers.
Often she vomited during the operation. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
food did not go down quickly enough the doctor
pinched her nose with the tube in it causing her even
greater pain.</p>

<div id="Illus32" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" width="600" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Lady Constance Lytton before she threw the stone at New Castle, October 9th, 1909</p></div>
</div>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon she heard Miss Edwards,
one of her fellow prisoners, cry from an open doorway
opposite, "Locked in a padded cell since Sunday."
Then the door was shut. She applied to
see the visiting magistrates, and appealed to them
on behalf of her comrade, saying that she knew her
to have a weak heart, but was told that no prisoner
could interfere on another's behalf. She protested
by breaking the windows of the hospital cell to
which, owing to her weakness, she had now been
taken, and was then thrust into the padded cell
as Miss Edwards was taken from it, the bed which
she had occupied being still warm. The padded
cell was lined with some India rubber-like stuff, and
she felt as though she would suffocate for want
of air. She was kept there till Wednesday, still
being fed by force.</p>

<p>On Saturday she felt that she could endure
the agony of it no longer, and determined to barricade
her cell. She piled up her bed and chair,
but after three hours men warders forced the door
open with spades. Then the chief warder threatened
and abused her and she was dragged back to the
padded cell.</p>

<p>In Miss Ainsworth's case the feeding was done
through the mouth. Her jaws were pried open
with a steel instrument to allow of the gag being
placed between her teeth. She experienced great
sickness, especially when the tube was being withdrawn.</p>

<p>Miss Hilda Burkitt's experiences were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
dreadful. She had already fasted four days and
was extremely weak when she was seized by two
doctors, four wardresses and the matron, who tried
for more than half an hour to force her to swallow
from the feeding cup. Then a tube was forced up
her nose, but she succeeded in coughing it back
twice and at last, very near collapse, she was carried
to her cell and put to bed by the wardresses.
"This will kill me sooner than starving," she said,
"I cannot stand much more of it, but I am proud
you have not beaten me yet." Still suffering
greatly in head, nose and throat, she was left alone
for half an hour and the matron and wardresses
then returned to persuade her to take food. On
her refusal they said, "Well, you will have to come
again; they are waiting." "Oh, surely not the torture
chamber again," she cried; but they lifted her
out of bed and carried her back to the doctors, who
again attempted to force her to drink from the feeding
cup. Still she was able to resist and then one
of them said, "The Home Office has given me
every power to use what force I like. I am going
to use the stomach pump." "It is illegal and an
assault; I shall prosecute you," was her reply, but
as she spoke a gag was forced into her mouth and the
tube followed. She had almost fainted and felt
as if she were going to die, and now for some reason
the tube was withdrawn without having been used,
but in her great weakness the officials were now
able to overcome her resistance and to pour liquid
into her mouth with the feeding cup.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on day after day. On
Thursday morning she was unconscious when they
came into her cell, and they succeeded in feeding her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
During the night she was in agony. She told the
doctor he had given her too much food and cried:
"For mercy's sake, let me be, I am too tired," but
brandy and Benger's food were forcibly administered.
During the whole month she only slept four
nights.</p>

<p>But the story of these sufferings had no power
to influence the Government. They were determined
to persevere with the forcible feeding and
were so far from abandoning this hateful form of
torture, that, evidently thinking the women who
had won their way out of prison by the hunger
strike had been let off too easily, they proceeded to
rearrest a number of them upon the most flimsy
charges. Evelyn Wurrie, who had been arrested
with Mrs. Leigh and the others, but afterwards
discharged by the magistrate, had been refused bail
between the time of her arrest and trial and kept for
seventeen hours as an ordinary prisoner in the insanitary
police court cells. She might have been
thought, therefore, to be entitled to claim damages
for wrongful arrest and detention, but was nevertheless
rearrested because she had broken the cell window
to obtain more air, and was sentenced either to
pay a fine of eleven shillings or go to prison for seven
days. She chose imprisonment, but her fine was paid
by a member of the Birmingham Liberal Club.
Miss Rona Robinson, Miss Florence Clarkson, Miss
Georgina Heallis and Miss Bertha Brewster, who
had all gone through the hunger strike in Liverpool,
were also summoned for breaking their cell windows,
in spite of the fact that they had already been severely
punished in prison for these offences. On
their refusal to answer to the summons, warrants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
issued for their arrest. Rona Robinson, who was
said to have committed damage to the extent of
two shillings, was arrested on October 15th in Manchester,
and was taken the same night to Liverpool.
Though her doctor had certified her to be suffering
from laryngeal catarrh and a weak, irregular action
of the heart, she was sent back to prison for fourteen
days' imprisonment in the third division. Owing
to the state of her health, the Liverpool authorities
refused to take the responsibility of feeding her
by force and she was accordingly released after a
fast of seventy-two hours.</p>

<p>The other warrants were not executed for some
time; that against Miss Florence Clarkson being held
over until December, when she happened to notify
the Manchester police of a burglary that had taken
place in the W. S. P. U. offices in that city. She
was then immediately arrested on the old charge;
bail was refused and she was kept in custody from
Saturday to Monday, when she was punished by a
further fortnight's imprisonment for having committed
damage to the value of 6d. three months
before. After three days (on December 15th), she
was released in a state of complete collapse. The
warrant against Miss Bertha Brewster was held over
until January, when she was sentenced to six weeks'
hard labour to pay for her 3/9 damage.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>OCTOBER, 1909, TO JANUARY, 1910</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Arrest of Lady Constance Lytton and Others at
Newcastle. Suffragettes Attacked at Abernethy.
Hose Pipe Played on Miss Davison in
Strangeways Gaol, Manchester. Mr. Asquith at
the Albert Hall.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Whilst our comrades were thus enduring agonies
in prison, protest meetings were being held in all
parts of the country. The <i>Daily News</i> said of the
people in our movement: "They are no longer men
and women; they are a whirlwind."</p>

<p>During the first three days of forcible feeding
£1,200 was collected. At a great demonstration in
the Albert Hall on October 7th, a further £2,300
was subscribed, and the £50,000 campaign fund being
complete, a fund of £100,000 was started. At
this meeting a procession of women who had already
gone through the hunger strike marched up to the
platform carrying the purple, white and green tricoloured
flags of the Union, and here Mrs. Pankhurst,
who was on the eve of her departure for America,
decorated them with medals in recognition of
their services to the cause. The scene was one of
the most tremendous enthusiasm; it was one which
none of those present will ever forget.</p>

<p>On October 9th a great political pageant was held
in Edinburgh, when a procession of women, led by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Scotch pipers and Mrs. Drummond in her general's
uniform, astride a prancing charger, marched
through the streets, accompanied by a number of
tableaux representing the figures of heroic women
famous in Scottish history.</p>

<p>On October 4th, Lord Morley, as Chancellor of
the Victoria University, visited Manchester to open
the University's new chemical laboratory. Deeply
moved by the sufferings of Mrs. Leigh and her comrades
in Winson Green Gaol, Miss Rona Robinson,
M.Sc., and Miss Dora Marsden, B.A., both graduates
of the University, and the former a subscriber
also to the new laboratory, attended in their academic
robes, and, with Miss Mary Gawthorpe, advanced
down the central aisle of the Whitworth Hall
of the University, just as Lord Morley was about to
speak. Each one raising a hand in appeal, they said
in concert: "My Lord, our women are in prison."</p>

<p>The rowdiness of the young men students of our
British universities is time-honoured; their almost
deafening shouts and yells and practical jokes, always
in evidence at functions such as this, are
invariably received with amused tolerance by the
authorities. Mr. Asquith himself, when addressing
the students of the University of which he is Chancellor,
did not disdain to wait with a smile until their
play was done before he could address them.
Nevertheless the earnest, quietly-spoken words of
these three young women were scarcely uttered when
they were pounced upon by a number of strange
men, who dragged them out of the Hall, and as
soon as they were lost to sight by the audience, fell
to striking, pummelling, and pinching them, as they
pushed them into the street. The passers-by rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
up to know what had happened, and at once the police
ordered the three women to move on. They replied
that they would not leave until their graduates'
caps and other belongings, which had been torn from
them, were restored, and until the names of
the men who had ejected them were given. Thereupon,
without further argument, the police seized
them and dragged them to the police station, where
they were accused of disorderly conduct and abusive
language, in Oxford Street. These ridiculous
charges could not be substantiated and were afterwards
withdrawn by the Chief Constable of Manchester
and the Vice Chancellor of the University.</p>

<p>Such women as Mrs. Baines and Mrs. Leigh, both
capable of the fieriest zeal and the most reckless heroism,
spurred on by stern first-hand knowledge of the
crushing handicaps with which the woman wage-earner
has to contend, and the terrible disabilities
which are rivetted upon her, had found it not difficult
to become rebels. The torture of women in
prison was now making it easy for gentler and happier
spirits to cast aside also the mere going on deputations
and asking of questions and, whilst doing
hurt to none, yet by symbolic acts to shadow forth
the violence that coercion always breeds.</p>

<p>On October 9th Mr. Lloyd George was to speak
at Newcastle and the town was prepared as though
for a revolution. Police and detectives were to
be seen in hundreds and great barriers were
erected across the streets. The night before the
meeting twelve women met quietly together to
lay their plans for opposing these tremendous forces.
Amongst them was Lady Constance Lytton, who
had already served one imprisonment for the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
in the previous February, and who, as daughter and
sister of an English peer, wished to place herself
side by side with Mrs. Leigh, the working woman
who was being tortured in Birmingham,&mdash;to do what
she had done, prepared to suffer the same penalty.
Mrs. J. E. M. Brailsford, who had joined the
Women's Social &amp; Political Union but a few
weeks before, was another who had come forward
to bear her share in this fight. (It was Mrs. Brailsford's
husband who with Mr. Nevinson had recently
thrown up his post as leader writer to the <i>Daily
News</i>, because of his sympathy with the Suffragettes).
Amongst these women were also two hospital
nurses, whilst two of the others, Miss Kathleen
Brown and Miss Dorothy Shallard, had already
won their way out of prison through the hunger
strike.</p>

<p>Next night, whilst vast throngs of people lined
the streets and the police were massed in their thousands
to guard from them the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
"the son of the people," as he called himself,
the twelve women quietly proceeded to do their
deeds. It was rumoured that Mr. Lloyd George
was to stay with Sir Walter Runciman, and, seeing
the latter gentleman's motor car driving through the
streets, Lady Constance Lytton threw a stone at it,
carefully aiming at the radiator in order that, without
injuring anyone, she might strike the car. Miss
Dorothy Pethick and Miss Kitty Marion entered
the General Post Office and, having carefully selected
a window in the neighbourhood of which there was
no one to be hurt, they went out and cast their
stones through it with a cry of "Votes for Women."
A number of other women were also arrested for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
similar acts. Mrs. Brailsford walked quietly up
to one of the police barriers and stood resting an innocent-looking
bouquet of chrysanthemums upon it.
Suddenly the flowers fell to the ground disclosing
an axe which she raised and let fall with one dull
thud on the wooden bar. It was a symbolic act of
revolution, and, like her comrades, she was dragged
away by the police. By direct order of the Home
Office bail was refused and eight of the Suffragettes
were kept in the police court cells from Saturday
until Monday, without an opportunity of undressing,
without a mattress, and with nothing but a rug
in which to wrap themselves at night.</p>

<p>Whilst the women who had thus been lodged in
prison had been making their protest outside Mr.
Lloyd George's meeting, there were men who were
speaking for them within. As the Chancellor of
the Exchequer was running through the list of taxes
in the Budget, a man complained that "there was no
tax on stomach pumps." The whole house rose at
that and the man was violently ejected. Many others
followed his example. Mr. Lloyd George
taunted them by saying: "<i>There are many ways of
earning a living, and I think this is the most objectionable
of them!</i>" and by asking: "Are there any
more of <i>these hirelings</i>?" Evidently he thought
that there were no men disinterested enough to support
the cause of women unless they received pay
for it.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>On Monday, whilst the other women received sentences
varying from fourteen days to one month's
hard labour, Lady Constance Lytton and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
Brailsford were ordered to be bound over to be of
good behaviour, and on refusing were sent to prison
in the second division for one month. The authorities
were evidently very loath to convict these two
ladies, one of them because of her rank, and the
other because of her own and her husband's association
with the Liberal party, but both were determined
to stand by their comrades and steadfastly
refused to express any regret for what they had done.</p>

<p>Their hope that their courageous action might save
Mrs. Leigh and the other Birmingham prisoners
from further suffering proved to be vain, and on
Wednesday, October 13th, Lady Constance Lytton
and Mrs. Brailsford, both of whom had refused
food, were released after having been imprisoned
for no more than two and a half days. Mr. Gladstone
asserted that in deciding to release them, he had
not been in any way influenced by regard for their
position, but that they had been turned out of prison
on purely medical grounds. It was indeed true that
Lady Constance was exceedingly fragile and delicate
and that she suffered from a slight heart affection,
but Mrs. Brailsford protested that she herself
was perfectly well and strong.</p>

<p>The eight other women were all forcibly fed and
all but two were retained in prison till the end of
their sentence. In most cases the nasal tube was
used; it always caused headache and sickness. The
nostrils soon became terribly inflamed and every one
of the women lost weight and suffered from great
and growing weakness.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 16th, Mr. Winston Churchill
was to speak at an open-air gathering at
Abernethy, some sixteen miles from Dundee. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
W. S. P. U. had no intention of heckling him or creating
any disturbance, for after much pressing and
a lengthy correspondence he had agreed to fulfil a
promise made to the Women's Freedom League in
the previous January to receive a Woman's Suffrage
deputation on the following Monday. Nevertheless
the occasion was thought a suitable one for distributing
Suffrage literature and for holding a meeting
somewhere in the neighbourhood. Adela Pankhurst,
Mrs. Archdale, the daughter of Russell, the
founder of the great Liberal newspaper, "The Scotsman,"
Mrs. Frank Corbett, the sister-in-law of a
Member of Parliament, and Miss C. Jolly accordingly
decided to motor over there.</p>

<p>They started off on a crisp bright autumn day,
the clouds high, the sun shining and the trees
all turning gold, and the little frost sparkles gleaming
on the good hard road. Everything began
auspiciously but before long they were held up by
a punctured tire. Owing to this delay they lost
the opportunity of giving out leaflets to the people
as they arrived, for the audience had already
entered the big tent where the speaking was to take
place when the Suffragettes drove up. Standing
in the road were some thirty or forty men,
all wearing the yellow rosettes of official Liberal
stewards, and as the car slowed down, they rushed
furiously towards it, shouting and tearing up sods
from the road and pelting the women with them.
One man pulled out a knife and began to cut the
tires, whilst the others feverishly pulled the loose
pieces off with their fingers. The Suffragettes tried
to quiet them with a few words of explanation,
but their only reply was to pull the hood of the motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
over the women's heads and then to beat it and batter
it until it was broken in several places. Then they
tore at the women's clothes and tried to pull them
out of the car, whilst the son of the gentleman in
whose grounds the meeting was being held then
drove up in another motor and threw a shower of
pepper in the women's eyes. The shouts of the men
reached the tent where Mr. Churchill was speaking,
and numbers of people flocked out and watched the
scene from over the hedge, but only two gentlemen
had the courage to come to the aid of the women,
and their efforts availed little against the large band
of stewards. At last, fearing that his motor would
be entirely wrecked, the driver put on full speed and
drove away. The only excuse for the stewards who
took part in this extraordinary occurrence is that
many of them were intoxicated.</p>

<p>On Monday, as he had promised, Mr. Churchill
received the deputation from the Women's Freedom
League. He then entirely departed from what he
had said during the elections both in Manchester and
at Dundee itself. In Manchester, when asked what
he would do to help to secure the enfranchisement of
women he had said: "I will try my best as and
when occasion offers." He had added that the
women Suffragists had "now got behind them a
great popular demand," and that their movement
was assuming "the same character as Franchise
movements have previously assumed." In Dundee
he had said that Women's Suffrage would be "a
real practical issue" at the next general election and
that he thought that the next Parliament "ought to
see" the gratification of the women's claim. Now
that no election was in prospect he said: "Looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
back over the last four years I am bound to say I
think your cause has marched backwards." He further
said that the mass of people still remained to
be converted and that, so far as he could see, women's
enfranchisement would not "figure either in the
programme of any great political party" or "in the
election address of any prominent man," and that,
until militant tactics were discontinued, he himself
would render no assistance to the cause. A more
flagrant example of political dishonesty than that
which these conflicting statements of Mr. Churchill's
presented, it would be difficult to find and not merely
the Suffragettes but the people of Dundee freely
expressed their disapproval.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Mr. Churchill was to speak in the
Kinnaird Hall, and huge crowds then filled the
streets and in spite of the tremendous force of police
the barricades were stormed. Led by Mrs. Corbett,
Miss Joachim, and Mrs. Archdale, they shouted
"Votes for Women," and rushed again and again
at the doors of the Hall. The three women who led
the crowds were arrested but the storm still went
on.</p>

<p>Adela Pankhurst and Miss C. Jolly, who had lain
concealed there since the previous Sunday, had
raised the cry, "Votes for Women," in a little dark
room, the windows of which overlooked the large
hall. After a tussle with the police and stewards,
which lasted three quarters of an hour, they were arrested
and with the three who had been taken in the
street, were eventually sent to prison for ten days.
They immediately commenced the hunger strike, and
were set free on Sunday, 24th October, after having
gone without food for five and a half days. Whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
they were in prison, huge crowds came to the gates
every night to cheer them, and on the next night
after their release the men of Dundee organised a
meeting of protest, in the Kinnaird Hall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, four Suffragettes were suffering the
torture of forcible feeding in Strangeways Gaol,
Manchester. They had been arrested in connection
with a meeting held by Mr. Runciman at Radcliffe,
and sentenced to one month's imprisonment, with
hard labour, on October 21st. They had gone into
prison on the Thursday, and had begun the hunger
strike at once, and on Friday the doctors and wardresses
came to feed them by force. Miss Emily
Wilding Davison urged that the operation was illegal,
but she was seized and forced down on her bed.
"The scene which followed," she says, "will haunt
me with its horror all my life and is almost indescribable."
Each time it happened she felt she could
not possibly live through it again. On Monday a
wardress put her into an empty cell next door to her
own, and there she found that instead of one plank
bed there were two. She saw in a flash a way to escape
the torture. She hastily pulled down the two
bed boards, and laid them end to end upon the floor,
one touching the door, the other the opposite wall,
and, as the door opened inwards, she thus hoped to
prevent anyone entering. A space of a foot or
more, however, remained, but she jammed in her
stool, her shoes, and her hairbrush, and sat down
holding this wedge firm. Soon the wardress returned,
unlocked the door, and pushed it sharply,
but it would not move. Looking through the spy-hole
she discovered the reason and called, "Open
the door," but the prisoner would not budge. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
some threats and coaxing the window of her cell was
broken, the nozzle of a hose-pipe was poked through,
and the water was turned full upon her. She clung
to the bedboards with all her strength gasping for
breath, until a voice called out quickly, "Stop, no
more, no more." She sat there drenched and shivering,
still crouching on the bedboards, the water six
inches deep around her. After a time they decided
to take the heavy iron door off its hinges, and, when
this was done, a warder rushed in and seized her,
saying, as he did so, "You ought to be horsewhipped
for this." Now her clothes were torn off, she was
wrapped in blankets, put into an invalid's chair, and
rushed off to the hospital, there to be plunged into
a hot bath and rubbed down, and then, still gasping
and shivering miserably, she was put into bed between
blankets with a hot bottle. At 6 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> on
Thursday she was released.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the whole country had heard of the
incident and an outcry had been raised. A correspondent
wrote that he had seen a hose-pipe played
on drunken stokers at sea. They were Norwegian
stokers, the officer would not have dared to do it
had they been English, but the passengers had intervened
at what they felt to be revolting and unjustifiable
brutality. The thought of turning that
fearful force of ice-cold water upon a woman already
weak from several days of fasting, was horrible
indeed to anyone who realised what it meant.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone himself admitted that the Visiting
Committee who had ordered it were guilty of a
grave error of judgment and ordered the discharge
of Miss Davison; but later on he addressed a letter
to the officials of Strangeways Gaol through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
Prison Commissioners expressing his appreciation
of the way in which the medical officers had carried
out their duties and commending "the efficiency of
the prison service, the carefulness and good sense
shown by the staff," and "the tact, care, humanity
and firmness" with which the problem of the Suffragette
imprisonments had been "handled by all
concerned."</p>

<p>The other Manchester prisoners were obliged to
complete their sentences, being forcibly fed during
the whole time.</p>

<p>At this point the Government had an opportunity
of learning the view of the electorate as to their
treatment of the women, for a by-election was now
taking place in Bermondsey and the Suffragettes
were, as usual, actively opposing the Government
candidate. In order that every elector might understand
as far as possible what forcible feeding
really meant, a pictorial poster showing the operation
was displayed throughout the constituency and
models representing forcible feeding were shown at
the W. S. P. U. committee rooms. A manifesto
against the Government was also issued by nine representative
men, including Mr. Brailsford, Mr. Nevinson
and Dr. Hugh Fenton, which urged the electors
"in the name of chivalry and humanity as well
as in the interests of true Liberalism to see to it that
whatever else may happen at this particular election
the Government candidate is left at the bottom of
the poll." The Suffragettes worked, if possible,
more vigorously than ever, and after the first
three days of their campaign, Liberal workers came
to them in despair, saying: "Why have you come
down to boss our election?" The Suffragettes never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
go to Liberal meetings at election times, but the
Liberal speakers were constantly being heckled by
the men and women of Bermondsey as to the forcible
feeding of the Suffragettes. The Suffragettes
themselves were greeted with cheers and words of
encouragement wherever they went. "All the policemen
in this constituency are going to vote for
you," one of the constables said, and others testified
that they preferred to keep order at the women's
meetings than at any other because "they talked
sense." In the result the Liberal candidate was defeated
and the Liberal poll was reduced by more than
1,400 votes. The figures were:</p>

<p>On polling day an unlooked-for, and to the
Women's Social and Political Union, unwelcome incident
occurred. The Women's Freedom League
endeavoured to render the election void, because
they objected to any election being held at which
women might not vote. The W. S. P. U. were
against this, because their policy was to prove
that the electors were prepared to defeat the Government
candidate in order to show their belief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Votes for Women. The attempt of the Freedom
League members to render the election void was carried
out in the following manner. Two members
of the League, Mrs. Chapin and Miss Allison Neilans,
each entered a separate polling booth with a
glass test tube filled with a solution of ink and photographic
chemicals which had been carefully prepared
to destroy the ballot papers without any risk of injury
to any person who might happen to touch it.
In each case the woman concerned broke the test
tube by striking it on top of the ballot box so that
the black liquid might fall into the slot. When this
was done by Mrs. Chapin a Mr. Thorley rushed
forward, and some of the black liquid splashed into
his eye. In Miss Neilans' case a man stretched out
his hand and some of the liquid fell upon it. In
both cases the men asked if the stuff would burn,
and were told it would do no harm if it were washed
off at once. Miss Neilans' own hands and gloves
were soaked with the fluid, but she suffered no harm.
Only five papers were touched by the fluid and none
of these were indecipherable.</p>

<p>A great outcry was raised, however, for it was
declared that Mr. Thorley would be blind for life.
For some time he went out wearing a black shade
over his eye, but when he was called upon unexpectedly
by some members of the Women's Freedom
League, he was found to be without the
shade and his eye appeared perfectly normal. The
cases hung over for some time and eventually,
on November 24th, Mrs. Chapin was sentenced
to three months' imprisonment for interfering with
the ballot box and four months for a common
assault upon Mr. Thorley, the sentences to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
concurrently; whilst Miss Neilans was ordered
three months' imprisonment. After a time it leaked
out that the slight injury from which Mr. Thorley
had suffered, had been caused, not by the liquid
which Mrs. Chapin had thrown, but by some ammonia
which he had used to counteract any after-effects.
Two days after Miss Neilans' release Mrs.
Chapin was granted the King's Pardon.</p>

<p>On October 30th Mrs. Leigh was suddenly released
from Birmingham Gaol, in a very critical
state, though two months out of the four to which
she had been sentenced still remained to run. She
was at once removed to a nursing home.</p>

<p>November 9th was Lord Mayor's Day, and, as
usual, the Lord Mayor had invited the Cabinet Ministers
to a banquet in the Guild Hall. Knowing
this, Miss Alice Paul, an American citizen, and Miss
Amelia Brown disguised themselves as charwomen,
and, carrying buckets and brushes, entered the building
with the other cleaners at nine o'clock in the
morning. There they hid themselves and waited
until the evening, when they took their stand in the
gallery outside the Banqueting Hall. When Mr.
Asquith was about to speak, Miss Brown, having
carefully selected a pane of the stained glass window
upon which there was no ornament, and which she
thought might be easily replaced, stooped down, took
off her shoe and smashed the chosen pane in order
that her shout of "Votes for Women" might be
heard by those below. Miss Alice Paul also took
up the cry. Both women were arrested and afterwards
sent to prison for one month's hard labour
on refusing to pay fines of £5 and damages of £2
ten shillings each. They were both forcibly fed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
as a result of this Miss Brown was attacked with
severe gastritis.</p>

<p>Three days later, on November 13th, Mr. Winston
Churchill visited Bristol to speak at the Colston
Hall. Miss Theresa Garnet, the woman who had
been twice through the hunger strike, and whom the
Home Secretary had wrongfully accused of biting,
resolved to humiliate Mr. Churchill, both as a member
of the Government which preferred rather to imprison
women than to enfranchise them and to torture
them rather than to extend towards them the ordinary
privileges of political prisoners; and also on his
own account for his slippery and disingenuous statements
in regard to the Votes for Women question.</p>

<p>She therefore met the train by which he was arriving
from London and found him on the platform in
the midst of a large force of detectives who formed
a semi-circle around him. She rushed straight forward,
and they either did not, or would not, see her
coming, but the Cabinet Minister saw her, he paled
and stood there as though petrified, only raising his
arm to guard himself. She reached him and with a
light riding switch, struck at him three times, saying,
"Take that in the name of the insulted women of
England." At that he grappled with her, wrested
the switch from her hand, and put it in his pocket.
Then she was seized and dragged away to prison.</p>

<p>She was charged with assaulting Mr. Churchill,
but eventually this charge was withdrawn (presumably
because Mr. Churchill knew that he would be
subp&#339;naed as a witness) and, on being accused of
having disturbed the peace, was sentenced to one
month's imprisonment on refusing to be bound over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile 30,000 men and women had turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
out to help the Suffragettes in their protest around
the Colston Hall where Mr. Churchill was speaking,
and during the evening four women were arrested,
and afterwards punished with from two months' hard
labour to fourteen days in the second division, whilst
several men who had spoken up for them inside the
Colston Hall were beaten unmercifully by the stewards.
Forcible feeding was resorted to in Bristol
Prison also, and handcuffs were used in some cases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the supporters of the Liberal Government
were adopting militant tactics on their own account.
What was called "A League against the
Lords" had been formed with the warmly expressed
approval of many of the Liberal leaders, and, though
the leaders had kept in the background, the members
of the League had twice assembled in Parliament
Square to hoot the peers as they drove by in their
carriages, and had come into collision with the police.</p>

<p>At the same time the Liberal newspapers were
openly commending the efforts of gangs of men who
were going from meeting to meeting held by the Conservatives,
and with shouts and violence were making
it impossible for their political opponents to speak.
Columns were devoted to describing the doings of
what was called "The Voice" which persistently
heckled Tariff Reformers and supporters of the
House of Lords.</p>

<p>Mr. Winston Churchill was now arranging to hold
a campaign of public meetings in Lancashire, and the
W.S.P.U. publicly and openly appealed for funds
to insure that protests and demonstrations should
be made in connection with all his meetings. Thousands
of pounds were, on the other hand, spent by
the authorities to defeat the women's intentions. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
Preston, in addition to many other precautions, seventy
men were employed and £150 spent on barricading
the windows and roof of the Hall where Mr.
Churchill was to speak, and at Southport £250 was
laid out on mounted police to protect the Empire
Music Hall alone.</p>

<p>When the Southport meeting began Mr. Churchill
looked ill at ease and turned about sharply from time
to time as though expecting an interruption. But
at last he seemed to gain confidence and was proceeding
briskly with his remarks, when, suddenly, there
floated down from the roof a soft voice, faint and
reedy, and peering through one of the great porthole-like
openings in the slope of the ceiling, was seen a
strange little elfin form with wan childish face, broad
brow and big grey eyes, looking like nothing real or
earthly but a dream waif. But for the weary paleness
of her, she might have been one of those dainty
little child angels the old Italian painters loved to
show peeping down from the tops of high clouds or
nestling amongst the details of their stately architecture.
It was Dora Marsden who with two other
women had lain concealed on the roof since two
o'clock in the small hours of the previous morning.
So unexpected and pathetic was this little figure that
leant further forward to repeat her message that the
audience could not forbear to cheer her. They stood
up, waving their hats and programmes, "looking delighted,"
as the loftily placed intruder herself observed.
Mrs. Churchill smiled also and waved her
hand and even Mr. Churchill, though this was probably
because of his wife's presence, and of the general
feeling of the audience, himself looked pleasantly up
and said, "If some stewards will fetch those ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
after my speech is concluded, I shall be glad to answer
any questions they may put to me."</p>

<p>But the stewards, who by this time had found the
women, were not disposed to bring them into the hall.
A hand was thrust over Dora Marsden's mouth and
she and the others were roughly pulled back from
their coign of vantage, pushed through a window,
and sent rolling down the steep sloping roof. "Stop
that, you fools," someone cried out, "you will all
fall over the edge," but one of the stewards answered,
"I do not care what happens." Fortunately two of
the Suffragettes were caught in their perilous descent
by the edge of a water trough whilst a policeman
seized Dora Marsden by the ankle, telling her, "If
I had not caught your foot, you would have gone to
glory." Once safely on the ground the women were
placed under arrest, but the case against them was
eventually dismissed.</p>

<p>At Preston, Suffragettes dressed in shawls and
clogs sallied forth at night and pasted forcible feeding
posters on the street pillar boxes, the prison and
other public buildings and the windows and doors of
the Liberal Club, as a welcome to Mr. Churchill, and
in connection with turbulent scenes which occurred
whilst his meeting was in progress, four women were
arrested. At every other town he visited the same
kind of thing occurred. At Waterloo, there was one
arrest, at Liverpool there were two, and one at
Bolton and one at Crewe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Harcourt had held a series of
meetings in the Rossendale Valley. On December
1st the door and windows of the house in which he
was staying were found to have been covered during
the night with forcible feeding posters. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
evening three men were set to watch with large hose-pipes
attached to the main, but somehow or other
the connection was mysteriously cut and the windows
were broken without their being aware of it by some
person or persons unknown. Two women were arrested
in connection with disturbances on the following
Monday, and were sent to prison for one month
and fourteen days respectively. They both adopted
the hunger strike, and were both forcibly fed. Two
women were arrested outside Sir Edward Grey's
meeting at Leith on December 4th, 1909.</p>

<p>A general election was now announced and on December
10th Mr. Asquith was to speak at a great
meeting in the Albert Hall and whilst the authorities
were making every attempt to keep them out, the
Suffragettes were, of course, making every attempt
to get into the building. Some of them did succeed
in concealing themselves inside, but were discovered.
Jessie Kenney, who disguised herself as a telegraph
boy and tried to get in while the meeting was in
progress, was also detected and turned back, but three
men sympathisers protested during the meeting. To
these Mr. Asquith replied, "Nearly two years ago
I declared on behalf of the present Government that
in the event of our bringing in a Reform Bill we
should make the question of Suffrage for Women an
open one for the House of Commons to decide. My
declaration survives the General Election and this
Cause, so far as the Government is concerned, shall
be no worse off in the new Parliament than it would
have been in the old." Thus Mr. Asquith was cheerfully
preparing for another general election without
one word of regret or apology to those women who
had been misled by his promise to introduce the Reform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Bill before Parliament came to an end. That
was almost the last of the old false promise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charlotte Marsh, who had gone into
Winson Green Gaol with the first batch of prisoners
to be forcibly fed, was still being detained there,
whilst Mrs. Leigh and all the rest had been released.
Those who went to visit her once at the expiration
of each month were only allowed to look at her
through a small square of perforated zinc. They
could neither see her clearly nor hear distinctly what
she said. Nevertheless they gathered that she was
suffering greatly. Our hearts ached for that noble
girl. Often there came before our eyes the picture
of the tall, straight figure that had carried the colours
of our Union before us in so many gay processions.
We saw the fair, fresh face with its delicate regular
Saxon features, those masses of bright golden hair,
the head so proudly held, and the faint flicker of a
shy smile that always came when one spoke to her; we
heard the boyish ring in her voice, and realised again
her earnestness and enthusiasm, and the unaffected
gentleness of her address. There was always something
about her that made many a woman think of
some dear young brother. Her father called her
"Charlie," and thought of her as his only boy
amongst a family of girls.</p>

<p>It was expected that she would have been released
on December 7th, but the Government who had held
her in torment for so long were anxious to extort
from her the very last ounce of their pound of flesh.
They determined not to grant her the remission of
one-sixth of the sentence usually allowed, but to withhold
it as a punishment for her refusal to take food,
and they did this though they knew that her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
was dangerously ill and though her mother had appealed
for her release on that ground a week before.
There was no fine that could be laid down to buy her
out, for she had been sentenced without that option,
and so perforce she must wait the pleasure of the
Government. On the 8th of December, it was
known that Charlotte Marsh's father was dying and
her family made another urgent appeal that she
might be brought to him. But it was not until the
9th that the Home Secretary at last tardily let her
go. She hurried at once to her home in Newcastle,
so thin and worn with what she had suffered, that her
sisters scarcely knew her as she came into the house,
only to find that her father was unconscious and
would never wake to know her any more.</p>

<p>Whilst Mrs. Pankhurst was still in America, the
case in which she, Mrs. Haverfield and the ninety-two
other women were concerned, which had been hanging
over since the summer, was heard in the Divisional
Court on December 1st. It will be remembered
that the Suffragettes had sought to put into
practice the constitutional right to petition the Prime
Minister as the representative of the Government
and of the King. They held that this right was especially
defined by two Acts, the Bill of Rights which
declares that, "It is the right of the subject to petition
the King and all commitments and prosecutions
for such petitioning are illegal," and the Statute 13,
Charles II, which states:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>That no person or persons whatsoever shall repair to His
Majesty or both or either Houses of Parliament upon pretence
of presenting or delivering any petition, complaint, remonstrance,
or declaration or other address, accompanied
with excessive number of people, nor at any time with above
the number of ten persons; upon pain of incurring a penalty
not exceeding the sum of £100 in money or three months'
imprisonment without bail or mainprise for every offence;
which offence to be prosecuted at the Court of King's Bench
or at the Assizes or general quarter sessions within six
months after the offence committed and proved by two more
credible witnesses. Provided always that this act or anything
therein contained shall not be considered to extend
to debar or hinder any person or persons not exceeding the
number of ten aforesaid, to present any public or private
grievance or complaint to any Member or Members of Parliament....</p>
</div>

<p>Though the women had complied with every provision
of the Act, Sir Albert de Rutzen had decided
at Bow Street that they had broken the law. In
appealing against that decision in the Divisional
Court, Lord Robert Cecil contended that in this country
there was, and always had been, a right of petition
and he urged that this right was a necessary
condition of all free and indeed of all civilised
Government. He pointed out that the right of petition
had three characteristics; in the first place it was
the right to petition the actual repositories of power;
in the second place it was the right to petition in person,
and in the third place it must be exercised reasonably.</p>

<p>In support of his contention that petitions might be
presented in person he quoted several historic instances
including a petition of women to Humphrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Duke of Gloucester in the reign of Henry IV, many
petitions to various powerful personages from all
sorts of men and women in the time of the Civil
Wars and the disputes immediately preceding them;
and petitions to the Lord High Steward asking for
the conviction of Strafford. In addition to these he
cited numbers of petitions presented in 1640, when
deputations came to the House of Commons and the
Members were instructed to go out and interview the
petitioners and hear what they had to say; a great
petition of 1680 as well as the petitions from the Gentlemen
of Kent in 1701; that of the Silkweavers in
1765; and that of the Trade Unionists in 1834; all of
which were presented in person. Throughout our
history it was clear, he declared, that petitions had
been presented, sometimes to the Houses of Parliament,
sometimes to powerful individuals and sometimes
to the King. He referred to a case mentioned
in Sir Walter Scott's "Fortune of Nigel," in which,
on King James II complaining of the way in which a
petition was thrust into his hand in the streets, a gentleman
named Jingling Geordie, had taken the opportunity
of presenting a petition to him then and there
in his private closet.</p>

<p>Even without these historic examples the Statute
13, Charles II (already quoted) was enough to
establish the right to present petitions in person.
The Bill of Rights had specially confirmed the right
of petition in so far as the King was concerned because
the right to present a petition to the King had
recently been called into question by the case of the
seven Bishops, which had taken place on June 29th
and 30th, 1688, in the reign of James II.</p>

<p>The case had arisen because the King had ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
that his Declaration of Indulgence should be read in
all the Churches in the country and the seven Bishops
headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury being of
opinion that the Declaration of Indulgence was beyond
the power of the King, had therefore presented
a petition to him setting forth this view. The King
declared the petition to be a seditious libel, and the
Bishops had been brought before the Court of King's
Bench. In summing up the case for the jury, Mr.
Justice Holloway said, "So that if there was no ill-intent
and they were not (as it is not nor can be
pretended they were) men of evil lives, to deliver a
petition cannot be a fault, it being the right of every
subject to petition." The jury found the seven
Bishops to be guiltless and the right of petition was
thus confirmed.</p>

<p>In quoting Mr. Justice Holloway's summing up,
Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that the use of the
words "to deliver a petition" clearly indicated that
the right was to present the petition <i>in person</i>. If
that were so, the women who had gone to Parliament
Square on June 29th had done so in the exercise of a
<i>constitutional right</i>. So long as they were denied
votes, this was their only <i>constitutional</i> method of
agitation for the redress of their grievances.</p>

<p>If, as was contended, the right not only to petition,
but to petition in person, belonged to each and every
subject, the only point left to consider was as to
whether the right had been exercised reasonably. If
one wished to interview the Prime Minister or any
Member of Parliament it was surely reasonable to go
to the House of Commons by means of the Strangers'
Entrance. The evidence clearly showed that Mrs.
Haverfield and the others had been on the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
highway and had been brought up to the door of the
House of Commons by Superintendent Isaacs of the
Police, so that up to that point they could not possibly
have done anything wrong. Opposite the door
of the House of Commons an open space had been
kept clear by the presence of a police cordon, the
crowd not being allowed to reach this point. Within
the cordon there were only members of the police
force, persons who had business in the House of Commons
and the eight members of the Women's deputation.
Therefore it was absurd to say that these
eight ladies had caused an obstruction.</p>

<p>It was suggested that the women ought to have
gone away because, as he put it, "a casual policeman"
had said that the Prime Minister was not in
the House of Commons, but that was really not a
sufficient answer. The ordinary procedure certainly
was not to take an answer from a policeman in the
street if one wished to interview a Member of Parliament.
The police had no right to stop anyone from
going into the House of Commons. It was also
said that the women had been given a letter from the
Prime Minister saying that he would not or could not
see them. "Had he said, 'I cannot see you here
and now, but I will see you on such and such an
occasion, this is not a convenient time,' that," argued
Lord Robert, "would have been a sufficient answer,
because the right to petition must be exercised reasonably,
but his letter contained an unqualified refusal,
and if the right to petition exists, that is no
answer at all."</p>

<p>Lord Robert then submitted that if there is a right
to petition a Member of Parliament there must be a
duty on the part of a Member of Parliament to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
that petition, and that no one is justified in
interfering with the exercise of that right. If the
women were legally justified in insisting upon the
right to present their petition they were also justified
in refusing the order of the police to go away for
there was no obligation to obey the police if the
police were acting beyond the scope of their proper
duties or contrary to the law of the land. In the
case of Codd v. Cave a warrant had been issued
against a man and a policeman had gone to his house
to arrest him without taking a warrant with him.
The man had declined to go with the policeman and
had knocked him down and injured him severely but
it had been held by the Court that the man was not
guilty because the policeman had no right to arrest
him without a warrant.</p>

<p>In delivering judgment the Lord Chief Justice
said that he entirely agreed that there was a right to
present a petition either to the Prime Minister as
Prime Minister or as a Member of Parliament, and
that petitions to the King should be presented to the
Prime Minister. But he said the claim of the
women was not only to present a petition but "to
be received in deputation." Had it been only to
present the petition he did not think that Mr. Asquith
would have refused, and he expressed the opinion
that his refusal to receive the women in deputation
was not unnatural, "in consequence of what we
know did happen on previous occasions."</p>

<p>In making this remark the Lord Chief Justice
showed that instead of concentrating his mind upon
the actual case before him he was allowing himself
to be biassed by inaccurate reports as to what had
taken place on previous occasions. As a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
fact Mr. Asquith never had received a deputation of
women since he had been Prime Minister and never
at any time had he received a deputation of the
Women's Social and Political Union in the House
of Commons. Therefore it was absurd to talk
about what had taken place on "previous occasions,"
and, moreover, even if Mr. Asquith had received
deputations on previous occasions and trouble had
resulted, the Lord Chief Justice would have had no
right to take these occurrences into account unless
reliable evidence as to what actually had occurred
had been laid before him in connexion with the case.</p>

<p>Relying on the Metropolitan Police Act of 1839,
which provides that it shall be lawful for the Commissioner
of Police to make regulations and to give
directions to the constables for keeping order and for
preventing any obstruction of the thoroughfares in
the immediate neighbourhood of the House of Commons
and the Sessional Order which empowers the
Police to keep clear the approaches to the House of
Commons, the Lord Chief Justice decided that Mrs.
Pankhurst, Mrs. Haverfield and the other women
had broken the law when they had insisted that they
had a right to enter the House of Commons and
that for this reason they had been properly convicted
and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</p>

<p>By this decision the Ancient Constitutional right
of petition secured to the people of this country by
the Act of 13, Charles II, and the Bill of Rights,
was, for all practical purposes, rendered null and
void. What is the use of a right that one may not
put into practice? Does anyone suppose for one
moment that the right of petition would have been
cherished as it has been, and that people would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
suffered heavy punishment for putting it into practice,
in troublous times, if it had merely consisted
in sending a written document obscurely, through
the post, or by a messenger, to the person in power
whom it was intended to influence? No, for the
right could never have been anything but valueless
had the presentation of the petition not been accompanied
by the pomp and circumstance, and the dramatic
and spectacular character, of a public deputation,
and by the influence that only personal pleading
can lend. Every scrap of evidence tends to show
that the right of petition was to be exercised personally.
If it were otherwise why should the Act
of Charles II have insisted that the signatories to the
petition should be represented by a limited deputation?
Moreover there is no suggestion that a written
document was required and that the petition
might not have been made, as it frequently was, by
word of mouth.</p>

<p>Shortly after this case of Pankhurst and Haverfield
v. Jarvis had been decided the Divisional Court
was again occupied with an appeal case bearing upon
the right of petition, this time at the instance of the
Women's Freedom League. In July the League
had followed the example of the W. S. P. U. in
claiming the constitutional right of personal petition
to the Prime Minister. After much preliminary negotiation
a deputation of their number had appeared
at the Strangers' entrance to the House of Commons
on July 5th and on being told that Mr. Asquith
would not receive them they had announced
their intention of waiting there until he should
change his mind. They were allowed to wait and,
reinforced by relays of others, continued to do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
right on into the New Year and were constantly to
be seen standing outside on the pavement both day
and night, whenever the House was sitting. Many
Members of Parliament appealed to Mr. Asquith
to receive them and so bring their weary vigil to an
end but he obstinately refused and always evaded
"the Suffragette pickets," as they were called. Usually
he left the House by one of the underground
passages but it was said that one night he hurried
unrecognised through their lines. <i>Punch</i> then published
a cartoon by E. T. Reed, entitled "Mr.
Asquith's disguises," showing the Prime Minister as
a cab driver, a postman, a policeman, an elderly
maiden lady and in other characters.</p>

<p>On July 9th, the pickets were also put on at No.
10 Downing Street, where they succeeded in waylaying
the Prime Minister at about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and ran towards him crying, "A petition!
A petition! Will you give us a hearing, Mr. Asquith?"
As he rushed past he snatched the document
from one of them, saying, "Well, I will take
the petition," and then fled on up the steps and
banged the door. The pickets were still waiting for
the interview when the police arrived to arrest them.
They were afterwards sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment
in default of paying fines of £3.</p>

<p>On July 15th four women again picketted Downing
Street, but were arrested and sent to prison without
even so much as catching a glimpse of the
Premier. On August 16th a line of women was
drawn up between the House of Commons and the
door of 10 Downing Street, where stood Mrs. Cobden
Sanderson and Mrs. Despard. This time they
saw Mr. Asquith, but though some of the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
spoke to him, he hurried on without making any
reply. Three days later, on the 19th, the line of
women was again formed, but Mrs. Despard, Mrs.
Cobden Sanderson and six others were placed under
arrest. Mr. Tim Healy, the well-known Irish member
of Parliament, was briefed for their defence, but
on August 27th, Mr. Curtis Bennett decided to fine
the women forty shillings or to send them to prison
for seven days. He stated a case for the High Court
and this was heard on January 14th, 1910, when the
Lord Chief Justice decided against the women, saying
that there were other means of presenting petitions
than going in numbers to do so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was announced that the cases against
the ninety-four women who were concerned with
Mrs. Pankhurst and Mrs. Haverfield would be withdrawn,
but at the same time application was made by
the authorities for the fines recorded against Mrs.
Pankhurst and Mrs. Haverfield and it was intimated
that unless these were forthcoming, steps would be
taken to arrest and imprison them. But immediately
after this, on Monday, December 6th, an official
receipt for the amount of Mrs. Pankhurst's fine
was sent to Clement's Inn and it was stated that the
money had been paid by some unknown person.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Two days later Mrs. Pankhurst returned from her
lecturing tour in the United States and Canada,
which had been a most triumphant success.</p>

<p>On December 9th, the action by Mrs. Leigh
against Mr. Gladstone as Home Secretary, and the
Governor and Doctor of Winson Green Gaol, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
as to decide the question of the legality of forcible
feeding by the prison authorities, was tried before
the Lord Chief Justice. It was pointed out on Mrs.
Leigh's behalf that there was no rule or regulation
to justify forcible feeding. Dr. Ernest Dormer
Kirby, who had attended her on her release, testified
that her condition was "distinctly grave," and that
she had then weighed no more than six stone six
pounds. Sir Victor Horsley, Mr. William Hugh
Fenton, Senior Surgeon at the Chelsea Hospital for
Women, and Mr. Mansell-Moullin all declared
forcible feeding by means of the nasal tube to be
painful, dangerous, injurious to health, and incapable
of providing adequate nourishment. Dr. Maurice
Craig, Consulting Physician of Welbach Street, and
late Senior Assistant Physician at Bethlehem Hospital,
who was called as a witness for the defence
of Mr. Gladstone and of the officials, said that the
operation of nasal feeding was "a simple one on the
average." He considered it more dangerous to
leave a patient starving than to overcome resistance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Jessie Kenney as she tried to gain admittance to Mr.

as a telegraph boy</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Richard Douglas Powell, also called for the
defence, admitted that he would not willingly resort
to artificial feeding unless it was "quite necessary."</p>

<p>The Lord Chief Justice said that he should rule
that it was the duty of the medical officer of the
prison to take all reasonable steps to preserve Mrs.
Leigh's life and to prevent her committing suicide.
The only question he should leave to the jury would
be whether the governor and doctor had taken the
right steps. In his summing-up he assumed throughout
that the jury must decide against Mrs. Leigh.
They did as he directed, and she thereupon lost her
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 19th, an action was begun by Miss
Emily Wilding Davison against the visiting justices
of Strangeways Gaol, Manchester, for having ordered
that a hose-pipe should be played upon her.
Judge Parry said that the use of the hose-pipe was
both ineffective and unnecessary; that the duty of
the visiting justices was to prevent any abuse of authority
by the officials of the gaol; and to report and
make suggestions. Therefore he held that they
were not justified in ordering the assault, and decided
the case in Miss Davison's favour. In assessing the
damages, however, he said that he should take into
account the fact that the hose-pipe incident had resulted
in the prisoner's release before the expiration
of her sentence; had provided her with "'copy' for
a vivacious and entertaining account of the affair in
the Press"; and had advertised her cause. Under
these circumstances the damages should be no more
than forty shillings, a nominal sum. The costs which
were charged against the visiting magistrates were
however placed on the highest scale because the case
was held to be one of great importance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was no lack of turbulent scenes
all over the country. Cabinet Ministers' meetings
were daily being interrupted both by women who had
succeeded in concealing themselves and by men who
urged the question of Votes for Women on their behalf.
When Mr. Lloyd George spoke at Reading
two women started up from under the platform,
during his speech. In the Queen's Hall, London, a
few days afterwards, a forcible feeding tube was
suddenly flung at him and he caught it in his hands.
As the stewards fell upon the man who had thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
it, Mr. Lloyd George cried, "I do not envy him his
paid job."</p>

<p>When speaking in the Louth Town Hall, Mr.
Lloyd George was referring to the House of Lords
as an "unrepresentative chamber" when a voice
from the roof remarked, "So is the House of Commons
as far as women are concerned." "I see some
rats have got in; let them squeal, it does not matter,"
said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and,
amidst a terrible uproar, Miss Hudson and Miss
Bertha Brewster were dragged down from amongst
the rafters where they had lain concealed for many
hours. They were taken to the police station,
charged with infringing the Public Meeting Act, and
detained in custody from Saturday until Monday,
both in the same small cell, which contained only one
narrow prison mattress and some rugs. On Monday
the magistrate discharged them with a caution, complimenting
them on their pluck. The Government
was averse to allowing them to be let off so lightly,
and on Wednesday Miss Brewster was rearrested
for having broken her cell windows in Walton Gaol,
Liverpool, in the previous August. She was sentenced
to six weeks' imprisonment, but gave notice
to appeal against the sentence on the ground that
she had already been specially punished for this offence
whilst in prison. On January 31st she was
released in order that she might prosecute the appeal,
and evidently thinking that the case hardly did
him credit, Mr. Gladstone announced that she would
not be asked to complete her term of imprisonment.
The appeal was therefore dropped.</p>

<p>On December 20th, Mr. Asquith had arranged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
speak both at Liverpool and Birkenhead, and owing
to his desire to avoid the Suffragettes, detectives
smuggled him across the river, amongst the luggage.
Nevertheless outside the Liberal Club Miss Selina
Martin and Miss Leslie Hall, who stood in the gutter,
the one disguised as a match girl, and the other
as an orange seller, spoke to him as he stepped from
his motor car, and urged upon him the necessity for
granting the franchise to women. He dashed away
without answering, and in protest, and by way of
warning, Miss Selina Martin tossed a ginger beer
bottle into the empty car which he had left.</p>

<p>Both women were at once arrested, and were
afterwards remanded in custody for six days. Bail
was refused, though Miss Selina Martin promised
that she and her comrade would refrain from militant
action until the case should come on.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The
women were removed to Walton Gaol, and were
there treated as though they had been ordinary convicted
criminals. They protested by refusing to eat
just as so many of their comrades had done before
them. Miss Martin also barricaded her cell, but the
officials forced their way in, pulled her off the bed and
flung her on the floor, shaking and striking her unmercifully.
Shortly afterwards her cell was visited
by the deputy medical officer, who ordered that she
should get up and dress. She explained that she
had been wet through by the snow storm on the
previous day and that her clothes were still saturated,
for no attempt had been made to get them dry, but
she was forcibly dressed and, with her hands handcuffed
behind her, was dragged to a cold, dark punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
cell and flung on the stone floor. She lay
there in an exhausted state for some hours, being
unable to rise without the aid of her hands and arms,
which were still fastened behind her back, until, at
last, a wardress came in and lifted her onto the bed
board. The irons were kept on all night. On
Friday, the third day of her imprisonment, Miss
Martin was brought up before the visiting magistrates.
She protested against the way in which
she was being treated, pointing out that she was still
an unconvicted prisoner, but she was told that the
officials were quite justified in all that they might
do. The same evening several wardresses entered
her cell and ordered her to go to the doctor's room
to be forcibly fed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I refused," she says, "and was dragged to the foot of
the stairs with my hands handcuffed behind. Then I was
frog-marched, that is to say, carried face downwards by the
arms and legs to the Doctor's room. After a violent struggle
I was forced into a chair, the handcuffs removed, my
arms being held by the wardresses, whilst the doctor forcibly
fed me by that obnoxious instrument, the stomach tube.
Most unnecessary force was used by the assistant medical officer
when applying the gag. The operation finished, I
walked handcuffed to the top of the stairs but refused to
return to the punishment cell. Then two wardresses caught
me by the shoulders and dragged me down the steps, another
kicking me from behind. As I reached the bottom
step they relaxed their hold and I fell on my head. I was
picked up and carried to the cell."</p>
</div>

<p>Next day she was forcibly fed and afterwards
again refused to return to the dark cell, but she says,
"I was seized by a number of wardresses and carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
down the steps, my head being allowed to bump
several times."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Leslie Hall had also broken her
windows and had been placed in a punishment cell
and kept in handcuffs continuously for three days.
After two and a half days' fasting she was fed by
the stomach tube. The doctor had taunted her
meanwhile, and jokingly told the wardress that she
was "mentally sick," and that it was "like stuffing a
turkey for Christmas."</p>

<p>On Monday, December 27th, the women were
again brought into court, when Miss Leslie Hall
was ordered one month's imprisonment with hard
labour, and Miss Selina Martin two months. On
returning to prison both the women refused to wear
prison dress and recommenced the hunger strike.
Each one was then clothed in a straight jacket and
placed in a punishment cell. Forcible feeding was
continued and they both grew rapidly weaker until
February 3rd, when they were released.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the facts as to their treatment whilst
imprisoned on remand had been widely circulated,
for they had dictated statements for their friends'
use whilst their trial was being conducted. Mr.
Gladstone wrote to the <i>Times</i> denying the truth of
the statements, declaring that the reason for refusing
bail to the women was that they had refused to promise
to be of good behaviour until their trial came on,
that no unnecessary violence had been used and that
the women themselves had made no complaint. But
indeed, the inaccuracy of Mr. Gladstone's statements
had become proverbial, for he was constantly denying
the truth of charges which were clearly substantiated
by the most reliable evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Lady Constance Lytton, in spite of her fragile
constitution and the disease from which she suffered,
again determined to place herself beside the
women in the fighting ranks who were enduring the
greatest hardship. Believing that she had been released
from Newcastle prison on account of her rank,
and family influence, she determined that this time
she would go disguised. She knew that, not only
her family, but the leaders of the militant movement
would try to dissuade her on account of her health.
She, therefore, decided to speak of her intention to
no one except Mrs. Baines and a few local workers
whom she pledged to secrecy. On January 14th,
she and Mrs. Baines organised a procession to
Walton Gaol. A halt was called opposite the
prison, and, having told the story of what was happening
inside Lady Constance called the people to
follow her to its gates, and demand the release of
the tortured women. Then she moved forward
and, as she had foreseen, she was immediately placed
under arrest. At the same time Elsie Howey
dashed into the prison yard and broke one of the
windows of the Governor's house by striking it with
a purple-white-and-green flag. She, too, was taken
into custody and, bail being refused, the two comrades
passed the night in the cells. Lady Constance
had disguised herself by cutting her hair, wearing
spectacles, and dressing herself in poor and plain
garments, and now she gave Jane Warton, seamstress,
as her name and occupation. Next morning
she was sentenced to fourteen days' hard labour without
the option of a fine, whilst Elsie Howey was sent
to prison for six weeks' hard labour. Then they
were dragged ruthlessly away to the torture which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
they well knew was to come. On arriving at the
prison, on Saturday, January 15th, they made the
usual claim to be treated as political prisoners, and,
on this being refused, signified their intention of
refusing to conform to any of the prison rules.
Thereupon they were forcibly stripped by the wardresses
and dressed in the prison clothes. At five
o'clock, on Tuesday, the doctor entered Lady Constance
Lytton's cell with four wardresses and the
forcible feeding apparatus. Then, without testing
her heart or feeling her pulse, though she had not
been medically examined since entering the prison,
he ordered that she should be placed in position.
She did not resist, but lay down on the bed board
voluntarily, well knowing that she would need all
her strength for the ordeal that was to come. Her
poor heart was palpitating wildly, but she set her
teeth and tried to calm herself. The doctor then
produced a wooden and a steel gag and told her
that he would not use the latter, which would hurt,
unless she resisted him; but, as she would not unlock
her teeth, he threw the milder wooden instrument
aside and pried her mouth open with the steel one.
Then the stomach tube was forced down and the
whole hateful feeding business was gone through.
"The reality surpassed all that I had anticipated,"
she said. "It was a living nightmare of pain, horror
and revolting degradation. The sense is of
being strangled, suffocated by the thrust down of the
large rubber tube, which arouses great irritation in
the throat and nausea in the stomach. The anguish
and effort of retching whilst the tube is forcibly
pressed back into the stomach and the natural writhing
of the body restrained, defy description. I forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
what I was in there for, I forgot women, I forgot
everything, except my own sufferings, and I was completely
overcome by them." The doctor, annoyed
by her one effort to resist, affected to consider her
distress assumed, and struck her contemptuously on
the cheek as he rose to leave, but the wardresses
showed pity for her weakness, and they helped her
to wipe her clothes, over which she had been sick.
They promised to bring her others in the morning,
but she was obliged to pass the night as she was,
for, owing both to the low temperature of the cell
and her own lack of vitality, she was always so cold
that she wore her nightdress and all her clothes both
night and day; even then her limbs remained stiff
with cold, and though, at last, as a special favour,
she was allowed first one, and then another extra
blanket and the cape which the prisoners wear at
exercise, she remained cold, for she says, "It was
like clothing a stone to warm it." When she was
fed the second time the vomiting was more excessive
and the doctor's clothes suffered. He was angry
and left her cell hastily, saying, "You did that on
purpose. If you do it again to-morrow I shall feed
you twice."</p>

<p>How very much easier would it have been to have
given in or never to have started this resistance?
How very much more natural to this gentle creature
whose whole life had been one of affectionate deference
to the wishes of others, who, because of her
kindly sweetness had been named by her family
"Angel Con," would it have been to save others
trouble and quietly to submit to the discomforts of
prison life. But where principles were in question,
none could be stronger or firmer than Constance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Lytton, and she was determined to go on with the
bitter thing until the end. Yet, through it all, her
gentle nature was apparent. She could not bear
that any of the ordinary prisoners should be brought
in to clean up the mess on her cell floor and, except
upon one or two occasions she always managed to
do it for herself in spite of her weakness and distress.
Notwithstanding his brutal rudeness to her, she even
tried to wipe the doctor's clothes, if anything was
spilt upon them. For the sake of the other prisoners
she tried, too, to help him with his hateful task
by making suggestions to him as to how it might be
rendered more efficacious and some of its horrors
mitigated, but her suggestions were contemptuously
disregarded. The third time she was fed she vomited
continuously, but the doctor kept pouring in
more food until she was seized with a violent fit of
shivering. Then he became alarmed. He hastily
told the wardresses to lay her on the floor and called
in his assistant to test her heart, but, after a brief
and superficial investigation, it was pronounced
"quite sound" and the pulse "steady." Next time
he appeared he pleaded with her, saying, "I do beg
of you, I appeal to you, not as a prison doctor, but
as a man, to give over. You are a delicate woman,
you are not fit for this sort of thing." "Is anybody
fit for it?" she answered. "I beg of you, I appeal
to you, not as a prisoner, but as a woman, to refuse
to continue this inhuman treatment."</p>

<p>From Wednesday, January 19th, and onwards,
she began to find that not only did she receive
greater consideration from the doctor, but that there
was a marked change in her treatment generally.
This led her to conclude that her identity had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
discovered or at least suspected, and she therefore
tried to take advantage of whatever privileges might
be made to her in order to secure concessions for her
comrades and to induce the officials to act with more
humanity. But, though she considered that she had
been treated with more kindness than was usual, we
learn that obvious simple necessities were denied her.
The processes of digestion were entirely stagnant and
she was losing weight daily, and though she made several
suggestions as to remedies and at last an aperient
drug was promised to her, it was never supplied.
She was right, however, in thinking that her identity
had been discovered. On Friday the authorities
made up their minds that she was not Jane Warton,
and on Sunday morning both the governor and doctor
appeared and told her that she was to be released
and that her sister had come to fetch her.</p>

<p>Lady Constance Lytton now sent a careful statement
to Mr. Gladstone asserting that the forcible
feeding was performed with unnecessary cruelty and
without proper care. He declared that all her
charges were unfounded, and the visiting magistrates,
having held a one-sided enquiry into the matter, announced
that the regulations had been carried out
with the greatest care and consideration.</p>

<small>1910</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The General Election, The Truce, The Conciliation
Committee, a Series of Great Demonstrations.
War is Again Declared. Another General Election.
Conclusion.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>With the opening of the new year, 1910, whilst
many of the women were still in prison, the General
Election began. The Women's Social and Political
Union fought the Government in forty constituencies.
In almost every one of these contests the Liberal
vote was reduced, and eighteen of the seats,
which had been held by Government representatives
at the dissolution, were wrested from them. During
the election the Liberal Government's absolute majority
over all sections of the House had been swept
away, and they were now dependent for their existence
upon the votes of the Labour and Irish parties.</p>

<p>The Suffragettes were now advised in many quarters
that the militant tactics had forced the Government
to the point of wishing to gain peace by
granting votes to women, but that Cabinet Ministers
were now afraid to do so lest they should seem to have
given way to coercion. The contest for supreme
power in the new Parliament being over, the women
therefore decided to give the re-elected Government
and the Parliamentary supporters of Women's
Suffrage a quiet opportunity to settle the matter between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
them. On February 14th, the W. S. P. U.
proclaimed a truce, and the Women's Freedom
League followed suit.</p>

<p>During the past year more than twenty thousand
meetings had been held by the W. S. P. U. alone,
in addition to the many thousands organised by
the other suffrage societies. Now that militancy was
to be laid aside a period of even greater effort in
the direction of building up the organisation and
extending the purely educational work was to be entered
upon.</p>

<p>Important developments were also to take place
within Parliament itself. For many years a committee
of Parliamentary supporters of Women's
Suffrage, had existed. This was originally inaugurated
on June 10th, 1887, under the influence of
Miss Lydia Becker. It was strictly non-party,
Members from all sections of the House having belonged
to it. During the Parliament elected in 1906,
however, the old committee had been allowed to
lapse. The Liberal supporters of the question
formed a Women's Suffrage Committee of their own,
and, abandoning the attempt to secure votes for
women, and seeking instead to extend the franchise
all around, they had put forward Mr. Geoffrey
Howard's Reform Bill, which had had no chance
of being carried.</p>

<p>Now, largely owing to the efforts of Mr. H. N.
Brailsford, a "Conciliation Committee" was formed
with the object of uniting all sections of opinion
favourable to women's enfranchisement and of coming
to a common agreement upon some particular
measure. The Earl of Lytton acted as Chairman
of this Committee and Mr. Brailsford, himself, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
Secretary. Its members consisted of twenty-five
Liberals, seventeen Conservatives, six Irish Nationalists,
and six members of the Labour Party. In
discussing the terms of the Bill to be adopted, the
Unionist members urged that it should be moderate,
whilst the Liberals insisted that it must give no
loophole for increasing the possibilities of plural
voting or of adding to the power of the propertied
classes. Though the majority of the women who
attend the English Universities do so as a preparation
for earning their livelihood, the Liberals did
not wish to see the Franchise for University graduates,
which is exercised by men, extended to women
because, as they said, the poorest women do not
graduate. For similar reasons they opposed the
granting of votes to women under the Joint Household
qualification, which applies only to houses
rented at twenty pounds a year and upwards; under
the Lodger franchise, which applies only to those
who pay at least four shillings a week for an unfurnished
room; and under the Ownership franchise.
To overcome the objections of the self-styled democrats,
the old Women's Enfranchisement Bill which
would have given bare justice to women by extending
the Parliamentary vote to them on equal terms
with men was therefore abandoned, and a measure
was drafted on the lines of the existing Municipal
Franchise of which the basis is occupation and under
which there is no qualification for Owners, Lodgers
or Graduates.</p>

<p>Local Government was the earliest form of government
in this country; it has been the most persistent
and staple. Government from the centre was
of later growth, and has many times been interrupted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
The Municipal Franchise as it exists to-day
is chiefly dependent on the Municipal Corporations
Acts of 1835 and 1839. Before the passing
of the first of these Acts women possessed and exercised
equal voting rights with men in regard to
matters of local Government, but the act of 1835
deprived them of these rights in all towns incorporated
under it. In 1865, however, Women's
Suffrage societies, demanding the admission of women
to both national and local franchises, sprang into
being, and when the Municipal Corporation's Act
of 1869 was before Parliament, Mr. Jacob Bright
succeeded in carrying an amendment to restore to
women the rights of which the Act of 1835 had
deprived them. It was a Liberal Government that
framed and carried the Municipal Corporation's Act
of 1869, and that Government accepted the amendment
to extend its provisions to women. There
was no suggestion then, nor has any since been made,
that that franchise, when exercised either by men or
women, is undemocratic when applied to municipal
purposes.</p>

<p>Therefore, following the lines of the existing
municipal franchise, the Conciliation Committee proposed
to extend the Parliamentary vote to women
householders and to women occupiers of business
premises paying ten pounds a year and upwards.
It was estimated that ninety-five per cent. of the
women who would be enfranchised under this
Conciliation Bill would be householders. To the
householder franchise no monetary qualification
whatsoever is attached, and every one who inhabits
even a single room over which he or she has full
control is counted as a householder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as this bill had been decided upon by the
members of Parliament, who formed the Conciliation
Committee, it was submitted to the various suffrage
and other women's organisations, with a request to
adopt it. Many of the societies, including the
militants, at first demurred on the ground that though
the number of women enfranchised would not differ
greatly, the principle of equality between men and
women, which the Women's Enfranchisement Bill
had laid down, would be sacrificed by the new
measure. Mr. Brailsford and others urged, however,
that the Conciliation Bill was the only one to
which the various sections in the House who supported
Women's Suffrage would agree. They also
pointed out that, as the women whom it was proposed
to enfranchise were already upon the Municipal
Register, no difficulty would be experienced in
adding the lists of their names to the Parliamentary
Register also before the next General Election, even
should this take place within the year. Therefore,
on condition that it should be passed during the
session, all the various women's organisations worked
wholeheartedly for the measure.</p>

<p>On June 18 the W. S. P. U. organised in support
of the Conciliation Bill a greater procession of
women than had ever yet been held, in which joined
numbers of organisations, both national and international.
Headed by a company of six hundred and
seventeen women in white dresses carrying long
gleaming silver staves tipped with broad arrows,
each representing an imprisonment, the massed ranks
with their gay banners took more than an hour and
a half to pass a given point. The Great Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
Hall was able to contain but a section of the
processionists.</p>

<p>No place for Women's Suffrage had been obtained
in the private Members' ballot. The Conciliation
Bill had been drafted in the hope that the Government
would provide time for its discussion, and five
days after the great procession, the Prime Minister,
in reply to an influentially signed petition of Members
of Parliament, promised to give facilities for
the second reading of the Bill. At the same time
he stated that he could not provide an early date
for this, but, just as the militant forces were preparing
for action, he agreed to fix Monday and
Tuesday, July the 11th and 12th, for the discussion
of the Bill.</p>

<p>The object of the Conciliation Bill's promoters
was, of course, not merely to secure the passage of
the second reading by a substantial majority, but
also that it should be sent for discussion to one of
the standing committees instead of being referred to
a Committee of the whole House; because, if the
latter course were pursued no further progress could
be made unless the Government were prepared to
provide more time.</p>

<p>As usual the attitude of the Government was anxiously
awaited. It was rumoured that Mr. Lloyd
George would speak in opposition to the bill, but
those who believed his professions of friendship for
the women's cause hoped against hope that he would
not do so. Mr. Winston Churchill had been several
times in conference with the officials of the Conciliation
Committee and had expressed sympathy
with their object. They counted confidently upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
his help. It is true that some days before the debate,
they had received a letter from him criticising
the terms of the Bill, but they still regarded him
as a friend to the measure. Nevertheless early in
the second days' debate he rose to make a bitter and
uncompromising attack upon it. He began by seeking
to prove that the grievance of excluding women
from the franchise was greatly exaggerated, that
they did not suffer any legislative disability therefrom,
and that neither the mass of the women
themselves nor of the male electorate desired the
enfranchisement of women. He went on to speak
vaguely of the danger of creating "a vast body of
privileged and dependent voters who might be
manipulated, man&#339;uvred in this division or in
that." Then, having elaborately striven to build
up a case against the granting of votes to women
on any terms, he proceeded with an air of considerable
magnanimity to admit that a slight grievance
existed because all women were disfranchised. He
was of the opinion that this grievance could only
be redressed in one or two ways; either by giving
the vote "to some of the best women of all classes"
or by giving the vote to every woman. The former
method he described as "the first way," and he said,
"I always hoped the Conciliation Committee would
travel along that road." In particularising his
favourite method of proceeding by means of his
proposed special franchises he admitted that no
doubt these would be "disrespectfully called 'fancy
franchises,'" and explained that they would give the
vote to "a comparatively small number of women
of all classes on considerations" of "property,"
"earning capacity" or "education." These special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
franchises would, he said, "be fairly balanced, one
against the other, so as not on the whole to give an
undue advantage to the property vote as against the
wage earning vote." "That," he said, "would not
be a Democratic proposal...." "It would provide
for the representation of the sex through the
strongest, most capable and most responsible women
in every class and that would meet the main grievance
in my humble judgment."</p>

<p>Thus the loudly professing democrat, Mr.
Churchill, proposed to enfranchise only those women
whom the members of the Conciliation Committee,
in the earnest and patient effort to comply with Mr.
Asquith's proviso that their Bill must be democratic,
had gradually weeded out. They had excluded the
property owners as such in favor of their poorer
sisters, the graduates, because only the comfortably
circumstanced can go to college, and the lodgers, because
the majority of women wage earners, to the
shame of our country, cannot afford to pay four
shilling a week for their rooms. These three
classes, the women who own property, those who
have graduated at college and those who earn comparatively
high wages, were surely those whom Mr.
Churchill had intended to indicate. The women
had agreed to their exclusion because, as compared
with the householders, their numbers were small.
This was the very reason for which Mr. Churchill
had selected them for inclusion, for he described
the Conciliation Bill as "an enormous addition to
the Franchise," though it would only enfranchise one
million women as against seven million men.</p>

<p>He went on to attack the terms of the Conciliation
Bill describing it as "anti-Democrat," and declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
that it gave representation to property as
against persons. "The more I study the Bill," he
said, "the more astonished I am that such a large
number of respected Members of Parliament should
have found it possible to put their names to it."
He complained that the bulk of married women
would not be able to qualify, but that a man who
owned a house and stable would be able to qualify
his wife for the former and himself for the latter,
as though that would not also be the case under his
own proposed "fancy franchises." He asserted
that the young inexperienced girl of twenty-one
would be enfranchised under the Conciliation Bill,
whilst "the woman who keeps by her labour an
invalid husband and his family" would get no vote.
Yet in practice we all know that girls of twenty-one
are not usually qualified either as householders
or occupiers, and in justice, and let us hope in its
practice also, the woman who works to maintain
her husband and family, is counted as the responsible
householder and would vote instead of the husband
she maintains.</p>

<p>He ended with a final appeal to Members to vote
against the Bill, saying that a vote on the Second
Reading of this Bill was equivalent to that on the
Third Reading of any other, and that those who cast
their votes for it, should be able to say, "I want
this Bill passed into law this session regardless of
all other consequences. I want it as it is; and I
want it now."</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith spoke against the principle of
Women's enfranchisement in general, and against
the Conciliation Bill in particular. He began by
saying that a franchise measure ought not to be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
to a standing committee but to one of the Whole
House. He declared also that his conditions that
proof must be shown that the majority of the women
desired any proposed measures for their enfranchisement
and that the measure should be democratic in
its character, had not been complied with.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the debate Mr. Lloyd George
also threw the weight of his influence into the scale
against the Bill. He stated that he agreed with
every word both relevant and irrelevant that had
been uttered by Mr. Churchill. Nevertheless he refrained
from depreciating the abstract principle of
Women's Suffrage as the Home Secretary had done,
and directed his attack wholly against the terms of
the Bill. In defiance of the fact he persistently declared
that the Conciliation Committee which had
drafted the Bill was "a committee of women meeting
outside the House," and that they had come to
the House saying, "not merely must you vote for
Women's Suffrage, but you must vote for the particular
form upon which we agree, and we will not
even allow you to deliberate upon any other form."
He said that this was a position which "no self-respecting
legislature could possibly accept;" yet
the Government had all the Parliamentary year at
their disposal to introduce what measures they chose,
and for years and years the women had been calling
upon them to formulate a Women's Suffrage
measure of their own. It had been urged, he said,
that this Bill was better than none at all.</p>

<p>"Why should that be the alternative?" he asked.
But when a member called out, "What is the
Other?" he answered evasively, "Well I cannot
say for the moment; but allow me, I am trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
concentrate for the sake of others who desire to follow
me in this debate."</p>

<p>Later he said: "If the promoters of this Bill
say that they regard the Second Reading merely
as an affirmation of the principle of Women's
Suffrage, and if they promise that when they reintroduce
the Bill it will be in a form which will
enable the House of Commons to move any Amendment
either for restriction or for extension I shall
be happy to vote for this Bill."</p>

<p>"Will the Government give time?" asked Mr.
Roch, a Liberal member, but the only answer was:
"That is a question for the Prime Minister."</p>

<p>Mr. Snowden, winding up the debate for the promoters
of the Bill, replied to Mr. Lloyd George's
challenge. He said: "We will withdraw this
Bill, if the Right Hon. gentleman on behalf of the
Government or the Prime Minister himself, will
undertake to give to this House the opportunity of
discussing and carrying through its various stages
another form of franchise Bill. If we cannot get
that, then we shall prosecute this Bill." Mr. Lloyd
George and the other members of the Government
sat silent. They well knew the difficulties under
which the Conciliation Committee laboured, and
they knew, too, that the women were striving at great
cost and sacrifice to obtain for their sex the largest
possible measure of representation; but with the
power to speedily bring the matter to a satisfactory
conclusion, they preferred to hamper the efforts of
both with obstructive criticism. As Mr. Snowden
aptly put it:</p>

<p>"It would pass the wit of man to put that principle
into a Bill which would meet with the approval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home
Secretary."</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour, Mr. Haldane, and Mr. Runciman
were amongst those who spoke in support of the
Bill, but the two Ministers urged that it should not
be allowed to pass to one of the standing Committees.</p>

<p>After thirty-nine speeches had been delivered the
division was taken. The Second Reading was then
found to have been carried by 299 votes to 190,
giving a favourable majority of 109, a majority
larger than that cast during the Parliament for any
measure and even for the Government's vaunted
Budget and House of Lords Resolutions.</p>

<p>A division was next taken on a resolution to refer
the Bill to a Committee of the Whole House. The
anti-Suffragists, in the hope of shelving the Bill,
those who feared to anger the Government and those
who genuinely believed that so important a measure
should be considered by the Whole House in each
of its stages combined to carry this resolution by
320 votes to 175.</p>

<p>The question was now whether the Government
would allow the few days necessary for the Committee
and other final stages. Practically all other
important legislative work was hanging fire because
of the deadlock in regard to the House of Lords
controversy. The Conference between the leaders
of the Conservative and Liberal parties, which, after
King Edward's death, had been set up to discuss
this matter, was still sitting and until its deliberations
were at end no progress towards a settlement
would be made. Therefore for the moment Parliament
had plenty of time on its hands, and urgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
pressure was brought upon the Government to give
out of this abundance to the Women's Bill.</p>

<p>On July 17th the Men's Political Union for
Women's Suffrage, the Men's League for Women's
Suffrage and the Conciliation Committee held a joint
meeting in Hyde Park, in support of the Bill. On
July 23rd, the Anniversary of the day in 1867 on
which the pulling down of the Hyde Park Railings
won the vote for the working men in the towns,
the Women's Social and Political Union held another
great demonstration there for which a space
of half a square mile was specially cleared. There
were forty platforms, many societies co-operated
and two fine processions&mdash;one from the East and
the other from the West&mdash;marched to the meeting.
The older Suffragists had also demonstrated in
Trafalgar Square, but on the very day of the
W. S. P. U.'s big Hyde Park meeting the Prime
Minister wrote to Lord Lytton refusing to allow
any further time for the Bill that session.</p>

<p>But Parliament was to meet again in the Autumn.
It was still hoped that the Government might concede
the time then. Resolutions urging them to do
so were sent in from numbers of popularly elected
bodies including the Corporations of Manchester,
Liverpool, Bradford, Nottingham, Glasgow, Dundee,
Dublin, Cork, and thirty others.</p>

<p>There were signs that the truce of the militants,
which had lasted for nine months, would soon be
at an end. This time it was men friends to the
cause who gave the first warning. On October 17th
young Mr. Victor Duval, now secretary of the Men's
Political Union for Women's Suffrage was arrested
for seizing Mr. Lloyd George by the lapel of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
coat and rebuking him for his hostility to the
Women's Bill as he passed into the City Temple
where he was to speak. Mr. George Jacobs, an
elderly man saw that the police were treating Duval
roughly and called out to them, "Do not hurt him."
He also was arrested and both men were imprisoned
for a week.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George had been speaking against the
Conciliation Bill in Wales, and numbers of Welsh
women Liberals plainly showed their disapproval
of his action. The women constituents of several
other Cabinet Ministers were pressing to be received
in deputation, and in view of the General Election
they could scarcely be denied. On October 27th,
Mr. Asquith consented to see the women of East
Fife. He told them that facilities could not be
granted before the close of the year and even when
asked what of next year he merely answered, "Wait
and see." Other Ministers seconded him. They
were all agreed in refusing to allow the Bill to pass
into law that year.</p>

<p>Therefore at a great meeting in the Albert Hall
on November 10th the truce broke&mdash;war was once
more declared. Mrs. Pankhurst announced that
another deputation would march to the House of
Commons to carry a petition to the Prime Minister.
She herself would lead the deputation, "If I were
to go alone," she said, "still I would go," but at
that hundreds of women's voices cried out from all
parts of the Hall: "Mrs. Pankhurst, I will go
with you," "I will go!" "I will go!" Then
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence called for funds for the
campaign, and nine thousand pounds was immediately
subscribed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>The Autumn Session lasted but a few days, for
on November 18, Mr. Asquith announced that Parliament
would be dissolved on November 28th, and
that a general election would take place. Even
whilst he spoke, the women,&mdash;450 of them, divided
into companies of less than twelve to keep within
the law,&mdash;were marching from the Caxton Hall
and Clement's Inn. Mrs. Pankhurst, Dr. Garrett
Anderson, founder of Girton College and one of the
medical women pioneers now over seventy years of
age, Mrs. Hertha Ayrton, the scientist, Mrs. Cobden
Sanderson, and Miss Neligan and Mrs. Brackenbury,
both of whom had reached the great age of
seventy-eight, were amongst the first little band.
They soon learnt that the Prime Minister had refused
to see them. Some of their number were
hurled back into the crowd. The remainder were
kept standing on the porch for hours with the shut
door before them and a surging crowd behind.</p>

<p>The companies of women who came after were
torn apart, felled to the ground, struck again and
again, bruised and battered, and tossed hither and
thither with a violence that perhaps excelled anything
that had gone before. One hundred and fifteen
women and four men were eventually arrested.
But the full story of that day's happenings belongs
to another, and, let us hope, to the last chapter of
this long fight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prime Minister forgot to reply
to Mr. Keir Hardie's question as to the fate of
the Conciliation Bill. Lord Balcarries then moved
a resolution which was practically a vote of censure
upon the Government for their treatment of the
women. Fifty-two Members voted for it, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
was lost. Eventually Mr. Lloyd George said the
Prime Minister would make a statement on the following
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tuesday saw the Women's Parliament again in
Session and the women waiting eagerly for the news.
Mr. Asquith said: "The Government will, if they
are still in power, give facilities in the next Parliament
for effectively proceeding with a Bill which is
so framed as to admit of free amendment." He refused,
however, to promise that this should be done
during the first year of the New Parliament.</p>

<p>Facilities for the Conciliation Bill had been asked
for; the reply that facilities would be given to a
Bill so framed as to admit of free amendment was
too vague to please the women. But the refusal to
grant an opportunity for passing a Suffrage Bill into
law during the first year of Parliament was more
serious. The Parliament now to be dissolved had
lasted less than a year. Who could insure a longer
life for its successor? Mr. Asquith had given the
women scant reason to trust any vague promises of
his.</p>

<p>Therefore Mrs. Pankhurst announced to the
women, "I am going to Downing Street. Come
along, all of you;" and the women went. The
police, however, gradually beat them back, and over
a hundred arrests were made. On Wednesday,
there were eighteen further arrests, and twenty-nine
more on Thursday. Many of the women were discharged,
but seventy-five received sentences of imprisonment
varying from fourteen days to one month.</p>

<p>Then came the general election, and again the
Suffragettes strenuously opposed the Government.
In almost every constituency fought by them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Liberal vote was reduced. A notable instance was
that of Cardiff, where a Liberal majority of 1555
was converted into a Conservative majority of 299.
Here the 800 members of the Women's Liberal
Association abstained from working for their party
because its candidate, Sir Clarendon Hyde, was opposed
to votes for women. The end of the election
saw the Liberal government still in power.</p>

<p>During the year the Women's Suffrage societies
had all grown largely. The Women's Social and
Political Union's salaried staff now stands at 110
persons. Its central offices at Clement's Inn occupy
twenty-three rooms, and a shop and thirteen rooms
have also been taken for the Woman's Press at 156
Charing Cross Road. There are also 105 local
centres of the Union. The income of the central
organisation of the W. S. P. U. during 1910 was
34,500 pounds excluding 9,000 pounds made by the
Woman's press and many thousands collected by the
local Unions. The twenty thousand pound campaign
fund is now complete.</p>

<p>The Conciliation Bill has been again introduced.
Again its scope and title have been modified to please
the "democrats." Its text now is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Every woman possessed of a household qualification
within the meaning of the representation of the people Act
(1884) shall be entitled to be registered as a voter and when
registered to vote for the county or borough in which the
qualifying premises are situate.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Act a woman shall not be disqualified
by marriage from being registered as a voter provided
that a husband and wife shall not both be registered
as voters in the same Parliamentary Borough or County
Division.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>In reply to a deputation of women who waited
upon him in October, 1910, Mr. Birrell said: "I
am strongly of opinion that in the course of next
year facilities must be given for the Bill. You
are perfectly right," he added, "in feeling irritated
and annoyed at the delay that has taken place and
in insisting on a date for Parliamentary action."</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith's promise is that facilities for a
Women's Suffrage measure will be granted during
this Parliament. Such statements as these must now
be held as binding, and the long standing Government
veto of this question must be withdrawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the gallant struggle for a great reform draws
to its close. Full of stern fighting and bitter hardship
as it has been, it has brought much to the
women of our time&mdash;a courage, a self-reliance, a
comradeship, and above all a spiritual growth, a
conscious dwelling in company with the ideal, which
has tended to strip the littleness from life and to
give to it the character of an heroic mission.</p>

<p>May we prize and cherish the great selfless spirit
that has been engendered, and, applying it to the
purposes of our Government&mdash;the nation's housekeeping&mdash;the
management of our collective affairs,
may we, men and women together, not in antagonism,
but in comradeship, strive on till we have built
up a better civilisation than any that the world has
known. For surely just as those children are fortunate
who have two parents, a mother and a
father, to care for them, so is the nation fortunate
that has its mothers and its fathers, its brothers and
its sisters, working together for the common good.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
